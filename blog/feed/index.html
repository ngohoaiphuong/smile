<p>Smile Direct Club’s CFO Kyle Wailes joined Yahoo! Finance Live to discuss the Company’s quarterly earnings results for Q4 2020 and long-term strategy for growth.</p>
<p><iframe width="840" height="472.5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdka9NBnyYs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In his interview, Wailes outlines several key initiatives that the Company is focused on to address its enormous untapped market potential around the world.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><b>Growing the Smile Direct Club Partner Network</b></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2020, Smile Direct Club launched its <u><a tabindex="-1" title="https://smiledirectclub.com/partner-network/" href="https://smiledirectclub.com/partner-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Network</a></u> to give consumers the option to get started directly from a dentist chair and doctors the option to offer Smile Direct Club aligner therapy to their patients. The company has since grown the Partner Network to include 1,000+ affiliated practices with partnerships with Smile Brands, DECA Dental, and more.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><b>Expanding internationally </b></li>
</ol>
<p>Smile Direct Club is a global oral care leader with a presence in 12 markets around the globe. An estimated 85% of people worldwide could benefit from orthodontic care, yet less than 1% receive it each year, with cost being the biggest issue. Smile Direct Club has plans to launch in additional markets throughout the year.</p>
<p><i>(Source: An independent study. Data on file at Smile Direct Club.)</i></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><b>Growing Smile Direct Club Teen</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The Company launched an offering specifically for Teens in 2020 and will continue to increase its efforts to grow its share of orthodontia’s largest market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve tried everything possible to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">make your aligners more comfortable</a>, but there is one spot that is still bothering you. So, you decide to give SmileDirectClub a call and our dental team suggests that you trim and file the area. But, how do you even do that?</p>
<p>Watch SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Dr. Riddhi walk you through the process below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOd1jpbCoGc" width="840" height="472.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>If the dental team advises you to trim and file your aligners, Dr. Riddhi suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use cuticle scissors, so you can make the smallest trim possible.</li>
<li>Trim as per the directions of the dental team, you can request a video call with them to walk you through it.</li>
<li>Once trimmed, use your emery board to file that area. Remember to buff in the same direction to reduce rough edges!</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: you can always take off, but you can&#8217;t put any back! So, take it slow while trimming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>by Riman Aburoumi</i></p>
<p>I never liked my smile. I had a gap between my two front teeth that made me self-conscious.</p>
<p>Growing up, braces weren&#8217;t an option because my parents couldn&#8217;t afford them. I had just decided to accept my teeth—but then a guy I work with told me about SmileDirectClub.</p>
<div id="attachment_3156" style="width: 339px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3156" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3156" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before.png" alt="" width="329" height="470" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before.png 806w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before-210x300.png 210w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before-716x1024.png 716w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before-768x1098.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3156" class="wp-caption-text">Riman before starting aligners.</p></div>
<p>He had a really big gap between his teeth, too. He got SmileDirectClub aligners, and after a month or so wearing them, he came to me and said, &#8220;Hey, look at this!&#8221; He took out his aligners, and the gap in his teeth was shut. I could not believe his teeth looked that good that fast. His gap had been bigger than mine, and it was gone.</p>
<p>I knew right then I had to try this. I booked an appointment that day for a 3D scan at a SmileShop in a CVS near where I live in New Jersey. I got my scan done the next day, first thing in the morning. It was really quick and really cool, and the lady there guided me through everything. I got my aligners a month later, in December 2019.</p>
<h2>Five months to a better smile</h2>
<p>I waited till the new year to start my treatment, so I put in my first aligners in January 2020. My teeth hurt for the first two weeks, but I stuck with it because I knew having a better smile would be worth the discomfort. Beauty is pain! Besides, my co-worker had told me the aligners would hurt in the beginning, so I wasn&#8217;t surprised.</p>
<p>I wore the 22-hour aligners, and the hardest part of having them was taking them out every time I wanted to eat something. It was such a new experience, but my co-worker was my mentor. I asked him so many questions. He gave me tips on the whole eating and drinking process and how to clean the aligners. I&#8217;m an EMT, and I was wearing my aligners during the peak of the COVID pandemic in New Jersey and New York. I was working in full PPE gear—respirator, face shield, the works—so my aligners were just one more item to put on and take off.<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3157 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2.jpeg" alt="" width="456" height="511" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2.jpeg 884w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2-267x300.jpeg 267w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2-768x862.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></p>
<p>I took lots of selfies so I could see the changes in my teeth. I could see a difference after a month of wearing aligners. Three months into my treatment, the gaps in my teeth were closed. It was crazy how fast my smile improved. My treatment was finished in just five months. I look at my before-and-after pictures, and it&#8217;s amazing how fast the improvements happened with my teeth and how much better they look. My friends and family all tell me how good I look.</p>
<h2>But could they be even better?</h2>
<p>I was so excited about my new smile. But I did notice that when I took out my last aligner, I could still feel little gaps in my teeth. People couldn&#8217;t really see them when I smiled, but I could feel them. I thought that maybe they could be a little tighter and closer. SmileDirectClub has a warranty that says if you&#8217;re not happy with the results, you can extend your treatment at no cost. I was hesitant to ask for more aligners because I thought I was being selfish or greedy. I was happy with my teeth. My smile looked great. But a little voice in my head kept saying, &#8220;What if it could be even better?&#8221;</p>
<p>After two or three months of wondering about it, I emailed SmileDirectClub customer service and asked them if I could do a touch-up treatment. I thought maybe my teeth looked too good to qualify for the warranty, but I figured it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to ask.</p>

<h2>Easy, free touch-up aligners</h2>
<p>The SmileDirectClub people were great. There was no hassle. They were glad that I was generally happy with my new smile, and they seemed excited to help me get them exactly the way I wanted them. They asked me to send photos of my teeth, and I did. They sent me an impression kit immediately, which I did and returned. In less than three weeks, I had two months of new aligners to extend my treatment and push my teeth a little closer together—all for free.</p>
<p>I am so glad I sent that email. I&#8217;ll be done with my touch-up treatment in time for my wedding in June. I can&#8217;t wait to smile big for our photos on the big day. I already know how perfect my smile will look—now I know it&#8217;ll <em>feel</em> perfect, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad I did SmileDirectClub. Both my original treatment and my getting my touch-up aligners were smooth and simple. Your smile is a big deal, and if you&#8217;re even a little bit unhappy with your teeth, you should do SmileDirectClub. I&#8217;m so much more comfortable with how I look now that I fixed my teeth. I smile more, I talk more, and I don&#8217;t worry that people are looking at the gap in my teeth. I love my teeth now. I&#8217;m so glad I decided to take the last step of getting my touch-up aligners. It was so worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>You&#8217;ve begun your Smile Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.  After wearing your aligners every day for weeks, you can already see a dramatic change in your teeth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re thrilled.</p>
<p>A friend of yours has made great progress with their aligners, too, and they&#8217;re only wearing them at night. That sounds like something you&#8217;d like to try—having to take them out every time you eat is getting a little inconvenient. And if it&#8217;s working for your friend, why not for you, right?</p>
<p>Hold up! Your treatment plan is customized, specific, and extremely important to follow to the letter. The same goes for if you&#8217;re wearing <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/introducing-nighttime-aligners-only-from-smile-direct-club/">Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> and want to try wearing them all day to move things along. Using your 22-hour SmileDirectClub Aligners as Nighttime Aligners or vice versa could slow your progress toward the smile of your dreams—not speed it up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h2>Moving teeth is serious science</h2>
<p>The science of moving teeth isn&#8217;t as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>See, Nighttime Aligners and standard SmileDirectClub Aligners are different. Sure, they may look alike. But each type of aligner is a highly specialized device designed to make precise adjustments to tooth position.</p>
<p>Nighttime Aligners are designed to move crooked teeth into a perfect smile in an average of 8-10 months and require at least 10 hours per day of continuous wear at night. SmileDirectClub Aligners are designed to move teeth in 4-6 months and require 22 hours of wear per day.</p>
<p>Your assigned doctor is a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist who was assigned to you to manage your specific alignment needs. They&#8217;ve used their expertise to create <em>your</em> treatment plan for <em>your</em> teeth. They&#8217;ve calculated exactly how much pressure the aligners will apply to each tooth and for how long. And the amount of time your aligner is out of your mouth is a part of the equation, too. Diverging from your treatment plan can disrupt that careful calculation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3147" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1.jpeg" alt="SmileDirectClub doctor" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1.jpeg 1920w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>And keep in mind, your smile is unique. The way your teeth respond to aligners may be different than other club members. There may be specific clinical concerns that the doctor had in mind when prescribing your aligners. For example, your wear schedule may be 22-hours because nighttime-only wear isn&#8217;t right for your teeth.</p>
<p>Simply put, Nighttime Aligners and 22-hour wear aligners are not interchangeable.</p>
<h2>Still want a change? Ask the experts</h2>
<p>You may have heard of people who have switched from one type of aligner to the other. It&#8217;s true that in some situations, you can make the change mid-treatment. But your teeth are unique, so there&#8217;s no way to know if it&#8217;s okay for you without consulting your SmileDirectClub doctor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we make asking questions really easy. If you&#8217;re in 22-hour aligners and want to switch to Nighttime Aligners or vice versa, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out to SmileDirectClub</a> via phone, chat, email, or <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smiledirectclub-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SmileDirectClub app</a>.</p>
<p>Your treating doctor may or may not be able to help you make the switch. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that a mid-treatment change may not be possible depending on your specific circumstances. Think of all the factors that make your smile special: your age, the presence of wisdom teeth, your degree of spacing, and more. Your doctor may have prescribed your treatment plan because it is the best—or only—way to get the results you want from your aligners. But your doctor can tell you for sure and help you understand why.</p>
<p>And one big, important thing to know: If you go rogue and don&#8217;t follow your treatment plan without talking to SmileDirectClub first, you will void the Lifetime Smile Guarantee. That means no free, additional aligners if you get to the end of your treatment plan and still aren&#8217;t happy with your smile. And worst of all, diverting from the plan means you may not get the smile of your dreams.</p>
<p>So stick to the plan. Trust the teeth-aligning science behind your prescribed treatment. And talk to the doctor before making any changes. We want you to get a smile you love, and we&#8217;re here to help during every step of your Smile Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lynne Gawley Hofstetter was never wild about her smile.</p>
<p>She felt that one of her front teeth stuck out too far, and her bottom teeth were crooked. She hid them by not smiling. &#8220;I never smiled a big, toothy grin,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t showing my true personality. People thought I was unfriendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had wanted straight teeth ever since she was a kid, but her parents couldn&#8217;t afford braces.</p>
<p>When Lynne became a parent, she bought <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/can-you-straighten-your-teeth-without-braces/">braces</a> for her two children, and she mulled getting braces for herself. After all, she still dreamed of straight teeth.</p>
<p>She consulted with orthodontists—twice—but after they told her how long it would take to straighten her teeth and how much it would <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a>, she decided braces were not for her. &#8220;Orthodontists talked me out of getting them,&#8221; says Lynne, who lives in Ontario, Canada. &#8220;I just decided to live with my teeth as they were.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;I decided to turn it all around&#8217;</h2>
<p>Nine years ago, Lynne&#8217;s world was upended when her husband was killed in an on-the-job accident. She was left a widow at 49. The years that followed his death were difficult for Lynne. &#8220;I got into a bad relationship after my husband died,&#8221; Lynne says. By the time it ended, she was feeling terrible about herself.</p>
<p>She needed a pick-me-up—something to help move her life in a positive direction. That&#8217;s when she saw an ad for SmileDirectClub on Facebook. Lynne looked into the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/">prices</a> and couldn&#8217;t believe how affordable the aligners were. &#8220;SmileDirectClub is an amazing option for those without health or dental benefits,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3125" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C.jpeg" alt="Lynne shows off her new smile with a selfie" width="547" height="546" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C.jpeg 1125w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-768x767.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></p>
<p>Lynne realized she could afford the straight teeth she had always wanted, and that she could get a better smile faster than those orthodontists had told her was possible. It was time to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was feeling really down, so I just decided to turn it all around,&#8221; Lynne says. She ordered an impression kit and improved her smile without leaving home.</p>
<p>She went with the standard clear aligners, and she wore them faithfully. Lynne saw improvements in her smile within six weeks. Six months later, she had the perfect grin she had always wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I have a straighter smile now—and, well, I can&#8217;t stop smiling,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I feel so vibrant and so excited. People tell me I glow!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The SmileDirectClub treatment fit her lifestyle</h2>
<p>Lynne couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it was to change her grin with SmileDirectClub.</p>
<p>Instead of going into a SmileShop for a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/">3D scan</a>, she went with the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impression kit</a> she could do at home. She made and returned the smile impressions. A bit later, her 3D images arrived, along with a digital rendering of what her new smile would look like after treatment.</p>
<p>She ordered her aligners. They arrived in the mail a few weeks later.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3117" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne4.png" alt="Lynee after starting her fitness journey and gaining confidence through her smile" width="403" height="623" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne4.png 654w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne4-194x300.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I was a bit skeptical in the beginning,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The aligners are so thin and almost flimsy feeling.&#8221; But she followed the instructions, and soon she realized those aligners were moving her teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was some <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">mild discomfort</a> as my teeth began to shift,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But I expected it. The SmileDirectClub instructions prepared me for that.&#8221; Lynne says she had a bit of a lisp when she was wearing her aligners, but that it wasn&#8217;t very pronounced. No one noticed the aligners when she was wearing them, she says.</p>
<p>The at-home treatments fit her lifestyle. She loved not having to schlep to an orthodontist&#8217;s office every month for adjustments. She had taken both of the children to those monthly appointments for years, so she knew firsthand how inconvenient it was. With SmileDirectClub, she changed her aligners herself and could talk to a specialist via phone, email, chat, or social, whenever she had a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not miss that part at all,&#8221; Lynne says of the in-person visits.&#8221;SmileDirectClub made this so easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Changing her smile changed her whole life, Lynne explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about the smile—it&#8217;s about taking care of yourself,&#8221; she says. A better smile made her get more serious about physical fitness, and she became a regular at a gym. Slimmer, stronger, and more confident, Lynne retired from her job as a chiropractor&#8217;s assistant.</p>
<p>She now works as a marketer for her gym, but just part-time, so she has more time to enjoy her life—especially spending time with her granddaughter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3118" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6.png" alt="Lynne takes a selfie with her current partner." width="482" height="556" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6.png 816w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6-260x300.png 260w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6-768x887.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /></p>
<p>But big life changes didn&#8217;t just happen around work. Lynne also found a new love. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a brand new relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m giddy in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>At 58, she&#8217;s never been happier. Her positivity rubs off on those around her. Straightening her teeth was a key part of her turnaround, she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I want people to know that you&#8217;re never too old to stop improving yourself,&#8221; she says. &#8220;By taking care of yourself, that has a domino effect on others. Happiness really is contagious.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a pediatrician in a hospital pediatric intensive care unit, Dr. Corey Chartan cares for some of Houston&#8217;s most medically fragile children. Outside of his medical practice, he keeps up with two small kids at home, too. That schedule doesn&#8217;t leave him a lot of time for self-care.</p>
<p>When Corey realized the impact of his childhood braces had slipped, and his smile wasn&#8217;t where he needed it, he wanted a fix. Corey lives with Brian, his partner of 10 years, and has two children, Brandon, 7, and Zoey, 6. He wanted his kids, and the children he treated in the hospital, could see his welcoming grin and his confidence.</p>
<h2>Just What the Doctor Ordered: A Warm Smile</h2>
<p>Even beneath a mask, smiling with confidence lights up his face, a key boost when connecting with his small patients, many of whom are recovering from the effects of COVID-19. Many can only have one parent with them due to current hospital restrictions on visitors. It&#8217;s a frightening time for adults and for children, who are also coping with grave illnesses in addition to the pandemic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3121" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7.png" alt="Dr. Chartan shows off his arm after his first COVID-19 vaccination dose." width="481" height="639" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7.png 1060w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7-226x300.png 226w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7-771x1024.png 771w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7-768x1020.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;They know me as the person who always has a big smile and cares about my teeth. It&#8217;s a warming attribute,&#8221; he says, referring to the ability to smile warmly. He wanted to make sure he cared for his own smile as well as he cares for his patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an important member of their family, someone that the parents can confide in and the patient, the kids themselves, confide in,&#8221; he says. A warm, confident practice that puts young patients and their caregivers at ease is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Corey practices at the Texas Children&#8217;s hospital, which <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> has ranked as one of the top five hospitals nationwide.</p>
<h2>Teledentistry Made It Easy</h2>
<p>Corey found SmileDirectClub via the internet and was quickly sold on the idea by the ease of the process. He could take <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impressions</a> himself at home—and a dental expert would review his records and create his personalized plan—all without him having to schedule an appointment in person.</p>
<p>In his case, he only had to wear his aligners at night. He didn&#8217;t have to worry about visiting an office again or swapping out gear mid-shift.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3123" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9.png" alt="Corey with his family and two children on vacation" width="494" height="496" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9.png 1406w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-300x300.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-1020x1024.png 1020w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-150x150.png 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-768x771.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>With <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/introducing-nighttime-aligners-only-from-smile-direct-club/">Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, Smile Direct Club customers wear aligners for 10 hours while they sleep, instead of 22 hours during the day. SmileDirectClub 22-hour wear aligners must be removed before every meal, then cleaned and put back onto the teeth afterward. That&#8217;s tough for a doctor constantly on the go throughout his waking hours, with little time for breaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that you can do your impressions at home, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">get your updates at home</a>, have your entire box come to you at once and have it all lined up and ready for you, to continue on your path to get the straight teeth that you want—this is definitely a great company and one that I would recommend,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I already have recommended SmileDirectClub to friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not all Smile Direct Club clients qualify for Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, since they are mostly for mild to moderate straightening needs, and plans are so personalized. But for Corey, it was the best option.</p>
<p>He has a specialty in pediatric pulmonary hypertension, which examines elevated pressure in children&#8217;s lungs. It&#8217;s a rare specialty but one particularly valuable during a pandemic that can cripple the lungs. He is often called on to review records from patients who don&#8217;t even live in his state, and the value of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/covid-19-shines-a-spotlight-on-telehealth-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/">telemedicine and telehealth treatment</a> suddenly feels more real, and also very reliable. He appreciates SmileDirectClub&#8217;s ability to conduct reviews of all patient records remotely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;If you asked me about this six months ago, I might have had a different answer,&#8221; about teledentistry. &#8220;But I feel like this is almost the new way of practicing certain types of medicine—and potentially dentistry and orthodontics,&#8221; he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Proud, Smiling Dad</h2>
<p>And for all Corey&#8217;s concern about his patients, the power of a proud smile is personal for him, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like a big smile with pretty, perfect teeth,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that always has been important to me. It kind of translates from work to home, smiling like that, feeling good about yourself and life and that sort of positivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees that translating to the attitude of his children as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I think having a big smile, and a warm smile, is important, but especially with my kids and my family.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3122" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey3.png" alt="Corey smiles with his family on vacation" width="793" height="590" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey3.png 1900w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey3-300x223.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey3-1024x762.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey3-768x572.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey3-1536x1143.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rainer Dawn did not have time for braces.</p>
<p>Sure, his teeth were crooked. &#8220;My canines stuck out,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People called me &#8216;Sharkboy.&#8217; It was not ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3106" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5.png" alt="Rainer's smile before SmileDirectClub treatment" width="345" height="500" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5.png 660w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5-207x300.png 207w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></p>
<p>But Rainer, now 18, had braces for a few months during his <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/teens/">freshman year</a> of high school. His orthodontist was 45 minutes away, and he wasn&#8217;t always able to make the 90-minute round trip every month for adjustments. He&#8217;d also recently gotten his scuba diving license, was gifted some gear, and had the opportunity to visit family in Indonesia for a long scuba diving trip. Metal braces didn&#8217;t jibe with extended international travel, so he had to choose. He chose the once in a lifetime experience and had the braces taken off.<mark class="" data-mark-id="3bc517e0-81a6-483a-af92-dbb4ce983adc"></mark></p>
<p>By the time Rainer reached his senior year of high school, he hated his teeth. But he still didn&#8217;t want to wear braces. Braces made him look younger, he says, and he wasn&#8217;t having it.</p>
<p>Then Rainer saw a SmileDirectClub ad on Instagram. He clicked through for more information and liked what he saw: straight teeth in months instead of years, with no monthly orthodontist visits, and no metal mouth. And all at less than half the average <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a> of braces.</p>
<h2>He made an appointment that day</h2>
<p>Never one to hesitate, Rainer made an appointment for that day for an initial consultation at a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/">SmileDirectClub office</a> that was 20 minutes away from his home in Santa Cruz, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour and a half later, I was walking into the office in San Jose,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I was just super impressed by the whole experience. I sat down in a fancy waiting room—there was kombucha on tap.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3110" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4.png" alt="Rainer shows off his aligners on a ski trip" width="610" height="420" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4.png 1378w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-300x206.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-1024x704.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>He was sold. He did his <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-image/">3D scan</a> and made a down payment that day. His purple box of standard clear aligners arrived at his door soon afterward. He wore his aligners as directed, at least 22 hours a day. His teeth got straighter after just three weeks of wearing his aligners. &#8220;It was a great feeling to see progress and know that you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Four months later, Rainer had the straight, white teeth he had always wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone from never smiling in photos to having a nice, big, wide smile in all my photos,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s changed the way I interact with people.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>He finished high school with straight teeth</h2>
<p>Rainer couldn&#8217;t believe how <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">easy</a> it was to get straight teeth.</p>
<p>His friends never noticed he was wearing aligners, and the discomfort was manageable. &#8220;It was just an amazing experience from start to finish,&#8221; Rainer says. &#8220;It was really simple to follow the instructions and stick with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He really loved not having to go to the orthodontist every month, like he had done when he had braces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3105" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA.jpg" alt="Rainer flashes his new smile after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="385" height="627" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA.jpg 1216w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-184x300.jpg 184w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-629x1024.jpg 629w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-768x1250.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-944x1536.jpg 944w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></p>
<p>Rainer&#8217;s mother, Erin, loved that he stuck with the plan this time. She had been hesitant to pay for SmileDirectClub aligners, even though they were <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/">affordable</a>, because she had already paid for braces for Rainier—$5,000 worth. She had not been thrilled when he insisted on taking them off so he could travel, but she had supported his decision.</p>
<p>But she was impressed with Rainer&#8217;s initiative in researching SmileDirectClub and then making the initial appointment himself. Even more impressive, Rainer had been working and saving up for a few years, so he was able to pay for the aligners upfront himself. Erin couldn&#8217;t be more proud of Rainer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;He stuck to the SmileDirectClub plan and was right on schedule changing out his aligners,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was gratifying to me to see how disciplined he was.&#8221; She credits SmileDirectClub&#8217;s treatment program with helping Rainer stay on track without her supervision. &#8220;I was impressed with how user-friendly it was,&#8221; she says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sees a change in her son now that his teeth are straight. “He smiles more. He has more confidence in public,&#8221; she says. &#8220;His dating life has improved, too.&#8221; <img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3107" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6.png" alt="Rainer poses in a professional photoshoot, showing off his new smile." width="397" height="594" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6.png 650w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p>Rainer finished his SmileDirectClub treatment plan the day he graduated high school. &#8220;I had worked so hard to get there, and to finish high school with straight teeth was an amazing, magical moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He plans to move to Los Angeles, where he wants to be an actor. &#8220;I really want to give it a shot and try to get into commercial work,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My new smile has made a massive difference in my life. I no longer have to worry about how I look when I smile because I have great teeth, which is just essential for that industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Erin Oprea shares her tips for reaching your health and wellness goals.</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/erinoprea/">Erin Oprea</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kelseaballerini/">Kelsea Ballerini</a> hosted a live virtual <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKuSqT4BLma/?igshid=1xhrzx8wfl3pl">smile-powered workout</a> for 25 sweepstakes winners and their workout buddies on January 26. Catch a replay of the workout below and read on for Erin&#8217;s fitness tips!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyzS3xONzic" width="840" height="472.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Most people know my work as a <a href="https://erinoprea.com/">celebrity personal trainer</a> to stars like Kelsea Ballerini, Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris, and Carrie Underwood. I train these and many other amazing clients in Nashville and even took my party filled workouts on a nationwide tour, hauling my husband along for the ride, all while Still training my celebrity friends back home in virtual sessions.</p>
<p>I never sought fame for myself, only focusing on perfecting my craft and making people happy. My hope has always been living the best life, for me and for my clients — <strong>which means a healthy body, healthy attitude, and of course, getting that confident smile beaming. </strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3088" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6300ff8d-b2b5-4920-960e-be28b749da0d.jpg" alt="Erin Oprea shows off her smile after a workout" width="416" height="515" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6300ff8d-b2b5-4920-960e-be28b749da0d.jpg 646w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6300ff8d-b2b5-4920-960e-be28b749da0d-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Many clients embrace a new-found excitement for fitness and wellness to set them on the right track in the new year. And starting off right in the new year is super important but I always stress, no matter the time of year, that your attitude will make all the difference in whether you succeed or not! You truly have to want it. You truly have to know that <strong>You’re Worth It!</strong></p>
<p>That smile you put on as your attitude and resolve does wonders for your own confidence and success. Even your daily fitness routine can become the powerful change that nearly everyone is desiring by respecting yourself, allowing yourself to be happy, and smiling at your perseverance.<a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/choose-smile/"> A simple smile has power</a>, remember that! Use that smiling attitude to empower your 2021 fitness goals! Without scaring people with a Cheshire grin of course, don’t get too carried away ;).</p>
<h2>A History of Fitness</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in fitness since I earned my first trainer certification at 18. I joined the Marine Corps at age 20 and served for nine years, including two tours in Iraq. Providing convoy security as a turret gunner during my first tour and then leading the first female platoon attached to the infantry in a war zone during my second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">During this time, I saw firsthand how vital fitness, nutrition, and a positive mental attitude were to thriving in difficult situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s no misprint, war requires a positive mental attitude, it’s just that what a marine considers a “positive mental attitude” tends to revolve around which way you point your weapon. It was very easy for me to see the advantages that correspond to civilian life and I have been able to extend that into my career, and even into my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I&#8217;m a bit of an oddball. It would be easy to wake up every day and let myself see the bad in this world. But I focus on the fact that we&#8217;re all blessed to be alive and able to move. I honestly thank God about this and purposely intend to make the most of every day!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3090" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b.jpg" alt="Erin shows off her smile during her workout." width="615" height="462" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b.jpg 800w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b-768x577.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" />I love to laugh. I love to have fun. We&#8217;re kind of wild in our house. My husband and I playfully tease each other. We dance, we sing to our dogs. Our kids, now 18 and 20, are (mostly) mortified. We don&#8217;t take life seriously for too long. When you smile, it brings you positive energy. A good laugh burns calories, makes problems melt away for a moment, and most importantly, can help make pretty abs.</p>
<p>That attitude extends to my work. I&#8217;m 43 now, and I&#8217;ve been training people since I was 18. It&#8217;s been my whole world, and I try to bring that same level of joy to each training session. I want my clients to say, &#8220;Wow, I feel amazing.&#8221; Even when the also say, “I’m glad we’re done with that workout!”</p>
<p>I look at every day like it&#8217;s a new challenge — what can I do that will make them feel better? What can I do to finally make this strong woman sore!? What can I say that will make my amazing client SMILE and forget for one moment that this just may be the 50<sup>th</sup> lunge I had them do today. Some days it&#8217;s even more about their mental health. My goal in every session is for them to leave feeling better than they started, regardless if that&#8217;s physical or emotional and I&#8217;ve learned to listen to my clients. It’s business as usual, even with the current COVID guidelines. Because even though I&#8217;m not able to always meet in person with clients, I’m flexible with virtual workouts and we kick butt! At-home workouts have soared in popularity, and I&#8217;m excited to help people get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I take a lot of inspiration from my <a href="https://prettymuscles.plankk.com/">Pretty Muscles app</a> — not from the business it brings, but rather the community around it, and the people who celebrate so much success. You&#8217;ll see them all over my Instagram account, their before and after photographs. Their excited post workout selfies. Their inspiration to others who may be teetering on the verge of a comeback.  Those inspire me so much.</p>
<p>Every one of them is so different, but what I hear the most is the emotional change, what they experience through finding themselves. It&#8217;s not just fitness, but through eating healthier and feeling better. Most of them are moms but people from all ages, races, and genders find my community! Those with kids have focused mostly on maintain or returning to a more active relationship with their children and spouses, and, maybe even more importantly, how they&#8217;re starting to focus on themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">They aren&#8217;t alone — they have a community that lifts them up on days they can&#8217;t do it alone. I’m proud to have been a part of that for so many amazing stories.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Move Your Beautiful Body</h2>
<p>My goal every day is this: Can I make one person move their beautiful body? I don&#8217;t mean that I want you to wear size 2, and that surprises people sometimes. Of course you should have goals in your life, but they should also be realistic. You&#8217;ll never feel satisfied if the goal always revolves around what someone else has. Your legs and someone else&#8217;s legs are always going to look different.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3091" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cad14588-14a1-4da0-8a84-31679dd46401.jpg" alt="Erin smiling in her home gym" width="428" height="529" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cad14588-14a1-4da0-8a84-31679dd46401.jpg 647w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cad14588-14a1-4da0-8a84-31679dd46401-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></p>
<p>Maybe you set a goal of working out for 20 minutes a day, and you invest in some cute workout clothes so when you lace up those shoes you feel powerful.</p>
<p>Maybe you set an intention of drinking more water, one simple habit to develop every day.</p>
<p>For some people, setting a weight loss goal backfires, especially a big one. You could set a goal of losing 50 pounds in a year, but then lose motivation when you notice the scale not changing as quickly as you expected.</p>
<p>But if you workout a little more, and maybe see a donut as a treat and not a daily breakfast, or swap out that can of soda for a glass of water, you&#8217;ll start to feel better. You&#8217;ll start to have more energy. You&#8217;ll flash that beautiful smile more. You may even start to smile at the mirror when you put on that cute outfit that makes you feel like a rock star. You can&#8217;t put a label on that type of honest confidence. It doesn’t have to be a monumental goal, it has to be a goal you STICK to.</p>
<h2>One Step Forward</h2>
<p>I know that sometimes, it&#8217;s not easy sticking to plans, and sometimes we fail. I try not to make resolutions, for example. I don&#8217;t say, &#8220;I want to be shredded and lean.&#8221; I like a good tequila and my donuts. If anything, every year I try to recommit to finding more of a work and family balance because usually I work so much. Each of the past 5 years I&#8217;ve set that resolution, and got a big fat zero. And now 2020 fixed that resolution for me, since we&#8217;re all at home, and I&#8217;m not on the road, and I found I enjoy my 30 minute afternoon coffee! Then right back to work sure, but I NEVER GOT THAT! WooHoo!! So you never know where your victories might come from.</p>
<p>I have one piece of advice I give to anyone asking how they can start on the path to a healthier lifestyle — <strong>just start moving</strong>. People ask, &#8220;Should I start with exercise or nutrition?&#8221; If you want the best answer, start with both. But one can also lead to the other.</p>
<p>Say you have a junk food craving. If you get up and go for a walk, often that craving subsides. Without any extra effort, beyond just going for a walk, you&#8217;ve already made a more nutritious decision for your body as you let go of that junk food dream. The more you move, the less you&#8217;re going to crave.</p>
<p>Another thing to do is <strong>break the cycle of sitting</strong>. How often do you sit and say, now I have energy? Never. The more you sit, the more your body wants to sit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3087" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026.jpg" alt="Erin Oprea flexing with Kelsea Ballerini" width="645" height="645" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026.jpg 800w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026-300x300.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026-150x150.jpg 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">One of my clients and close friends, Kelsea Ballerini, adds “Fresh air gives you energy, too. I know it&#8217;s cold. That&#8217;s why we have those amazing layers in the winter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, pull on your coat, grab your gloves, and <strong>just start walking</strong>. Maybe even grab your dog, they’ll love it I swear!</p>
<p>And I always tell my clients to <strong>smile during a workout</strong>, or whenever they move their bodies. Smiling can trick your brain into releasing endorphins which in turn helps you reach your fitness goals more efficiently and helps empower yourself to stick to your goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Movement is a gift. Don&#8217;t look at it as a chore — take advantage of the gift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And never stop smiling.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2020 was a year of change for Diana Hairston, for so many reasons.</p>
<p>In January, the Baltimore mom of two young children, ages 4 and 1, and her husband, a musician, moved their family from a neighborhood she describes as riddled by crime and violence to a safer home, near the city&#8217;s Inner Harbor and sports stadiums downtown. She also landed a new job as a paralegal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3082" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM.png" alt="Diana with her family" width="682" height="450" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM.png 2132w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-300x198.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-1024x675.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-768x506.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-1536x1013.png 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-2048x1351.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Everything was a fresh start —taking my children out of this bad area, starting a new job,&#8221; she says. That fresh start also inspired Diana to focus on something special for herself — something she had wanted to do for years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just before the pandemic closed down cities nationwide, Diana invested in something for herself — her smile.</p>
<p>She had three gaps in her teeth, she says, one in the center, and two large ones on the sides.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3083" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM.png" alt="Diana's smile - showcasing her main concerns for purchasing aligners" width="404" height="540" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM.png 1058w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM-224x300.png 224w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM-766x1024.png 766w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM-768x1026.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;If I turned to the side it looked like I had a missing tooth,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like to show my teeth a lot.&#8221; She would smile for photos only when she faced the camera — nothing to the side — so her gaps didn&#8217;t show.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was younger I used to have insecurities about it,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Growing up, Diana was one of six children in a family that didn&#8217;t have a lot of extra money. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to put the burden of braces on my parents growing up,&#8221; she explains.</p>
<p>And while her husband told her she looked beautiful, she still felt self conscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I became an adult I said, &#8216;OK, I can take care of my own finances at this point, I should be able to fix my teeth.'&#8221; Still, Diana worried about the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a> of traditional orthodontia.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub ads kept appearing on her Facebook page, she says, and the cost of $89 a month seemed affordable. She took her <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impressions</a>, and used the smile stretcher to take photos of all of her teeth, as SmileDirectClub suggests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I looked at the picture after I was done and I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m going through with it. I have to&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sent both back to the company so SmileDirectClub dentists could review those along with her records, and plan her treatment. That was toward the end of February. Around the beginning of March, she received her first aligners.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Diana started sharing personal videos to document the silly toddler antics in her home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXQChvilP0&amp;t=31s">YouTube</a>. This year she added personal testimonials about her journey to a better smile and new confidence. She posted video blog entries of her experiences online. She had seen some negative feedback about SmileDirectClub, and saw that many potential customers had questions. Her videos aim to ease those concerns by walking viewers through her experiences at every point.</p>

<p>In sum: The process and the aligners really do work. And the reactions she&#8217;s gotten to her videos have been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>Diana&#8217;s advice to anyone interested in SmileDirectClub is to try it – and also make sure to follow the guidelines. In her case, she needed to wear her aligners <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">22 hours a day</a>, and she stuck to that. She wonders if perhaps those with negative experiences didn&#8217;t really follow the guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re investing in something you want to make sure you get the best out of it,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Sadly, the year hasn&#8217;t all been a happy, healthy restart. Diana, as well as several family members, caught COVID-1<img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3084" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM.png" alt="Diana smiling and showing off her results after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="453" height="384" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM.png 1662w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-300x254.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-1024x868.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-768x651.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-1536x1301.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" />9, including her father, who was hospitalized. She&#8217;s lost some relatives to the disease, making this a rather difficult time.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;s tried to focus on the joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still able to say I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m healthy, I have two beautiful children, I have a job,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>And she has her smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people say your smile shows who you are. Before this, I didn&#8217;t smile as much because I was afraid to show my teeth. It feels bad when you&#8217;re around people and can&#8217;t show your true self because you&#8217;re ashamed of your hair or your teeth,&#8221; Diana says.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Now I can show the joy around me.&#8221;</p>
