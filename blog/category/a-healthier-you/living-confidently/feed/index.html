										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Erin Oprea shares her tips for reaching your health and wellness goals.</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/erinoprea/">Erin Oprea</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kelseaballerini/">Kelsea Ballerini</a> hosted a live virtual <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CKuSqT4BLma/?igshid=1xhrzx8wfl3pl">smile-powered workout</a> for 25 sweepstakes winners and their workout buddies on January 26. Catch a replay of the workout below and read on for Erin&#8217;s fitness tips!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyzS3xONzic" width="840" height="472.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>Most people know my work as a <a href="https://erinoprea.com/">celebrity personal trainer</a> to stars like Kelsea Ballerini, Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris, and Carrie Underwood. I train these and many other amazing clients in Nashville and even took my party filled workouts on a nationwide tour, hauling my husband along for the ride, all while Still training my celebrity friends back home in virtual sessions.</p>
<p>I never sought fame for myself, only focusing on perfecting my craft and making people happy. My hope has always been living the best life, for me and for my clients — <strong>which means a healthy body, healthy attitude, and of course, getting that confident smile beaming. </strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3088" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6300ff8d-b2b5-4920-960e-be28b749da0d.jpg" alt="Erin Oprea shows off her smile after a workout" width="416" height="515" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6300ff8d-b2b5-4920-960e-be28b749da0d.jpg 646w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6300ff8d-b2b5-4920-960e-be28b749da0d-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" /></p>
<p>Many clients embrace a new-found excitement for fitness and wellness to set them on the right track in the new year. And starting off right in the new year is super important but I always stress, no matter the time of year, that your attitude will make all the difference in whether you succeed or not! You truly have to want it. You truly have to know that <strong>You’re Worth It!</strong></p>
<p>That smile you put on as your attitude and resolve does wonders for your own confidence and success. Even your daily fitness routine can become the powerful change that nearly everyone is desiring by respecting yourself, allowing yourself to be happy, and smiling at your perseverance.<a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/choose-smile/"> A simple smile has power</a>, remember that! Use that smiling attitude to empower your 2021 fitness goals! Without scaring people with a Cheshire grin of course, don’t get too carried away ;).</p>
<h2>A History of Fitness</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in fitness since I earned my first trainer certification at 18. I joined the Marine Corps at age 20 and served for nine years, including two tours in Iraq. Providing convoy security as a turret gunner during my first tour and then leading the first female platoon attached to the infantry in a war zone during my second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">During this time, I saw firsthand how vital fitness, nutrition, and a positive mental attitude were to thriving in difficult situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s no misprint, war requires a positive mental attitude, it’s just that what a marine considers a “positive mental attitude” tends to revolve around which way you point your weapon. It was very easy for me to see the advantages that correspond to civilian life and I have been able to extend that into my career, and even into my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I&#8217;m a bit of an oddball. It would be easy to wake up every day and let myself see the bad in this world. But I focus on the fact that we&#8217;re all blessed to be alive and able to move. I honestly thank God about this and purposely intend to make the most of every day!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3090" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b.jpg" alt="Erin shows off her smile during her workout." width="615" height="462" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b.jpg 800w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f9ada781-3ada-439a-b7b6-c71cf290035b-768x577.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" />I love to laugh. I love to have fun. We&#8217;re kind of wild in our house. My husband and I playfully tease each other. We dance, we sing to our dogs. Our kids, now 18 and 20, are (mostly) mortified. We don&#8217;t take life seriously for too long. When you smile, it brings you positive energy. A good laugh burns calories, makes problems melt away for a moment, and most importantly, can help make pretty abs.</p>
<p>That attitude extends to my work. I&#8217;m 43 now, and I&#8217;ve been training people since I was 18. It&#8217;s been my whole world, and I try to bring that same level of joy to each training session. I want my clients to say, &#8220;Wow, I feel amazing.&#8221; Even when the also say, “I’m glad we’re done with that workout!”</p>
<p>I look at every day like it&#8217;s a new challenge — what can I do that will make them feel better? What can I do to finally make this strong woman sore!? What can I say that will make my amazing client SMILE and forget for one moment that this just may be the 50<sup>th</sup> lunge I had them do today. Some days it&#8217;s even more about their mental health. My goal in every session is for them to leave feeling better than they started, regardless if that&#8217;s physical or emotional and I&#8217;ve learned to listen to my clients. It’s business as usual, even with the current COVID guidelines. Because even though I&#8217;m not able to always meet in person with clients, I’m flexible with virtual workouts and we kick butt! At-home workouts have soared in popularity, and I&#8217;m excited to help people get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I take a lot of inspiration from my <a href="https://prettymuscles.plankk.com/">Pretty Muscles app</a> — not from the business it brings, but rather the community around it, and the people who celebrate so much success. You&#8217;ll see them all over my Instagram account, their before and after photographs. Their excited post workout selfies. Their inspiration to others who may be teetering on the verge of a comeback.  Those inspire me so much.</p>
<p>Every one of them is so different, but what I hear the most is the emotional change, what they experience through finding themselves. It&#8217;s not just fitness, but through eating healthier and feeling better. Most of them are moms but people from all ages, races, and genders find my community! Those with kids have focused mostly on maintain or returning to a more active relationship with their children and spouses, and, maybe even more importantly, how they&#8217;re starting to focus on themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">They aren&#8217;t alone — they have a community that lifts them up on days they can&#8217;t do it alone. I’m proud to have been a part of that for so many amazing stories.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Move Your Beautiful Body</h2>
<p>My goal every day is this: Can I make one person move their beautiful body? I don&#8217;t mean that I want you to wear size 2, and that surprises people sometimes. Of course you should have goals in your life, but they should also be realistic. You&#8217;ll never feel satisfied if the goal always revolves around what someone else has. Your legs and someone else&#8217;s legs are always going to look different.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3091" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cad14588-14a1-4da0-8a84-31679dd46401.jpg" alt="Erin smiling in her home gym" width="428" height="529" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cad14588-14a1-4da0-8a84-31679dd46401.jpg 647w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cad14588-14a1-4da0-8a84-31679dd46401-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /></p>
<p>Maybe you set a goal of working out for 20 minutes a day, and you invest in some cute workout clothes so when you lace up those shoes you feel powerful.</p>
<p>Maybe you set an intention of drinking more water, one simple habit to develop every day.</p>
<p>For some people, setting a weight loss goal backfires, especially a big one. You could set a goal of losing 50 pounds in a year, but then lose motivation when you notice the scale not changing as quickly as you expected.</p>
<p>But if you workout a little more, and maybe see a donut as a treat and not a daily breakfast, or swap out that can of soda for a glass of water, you&#8217;ll start to feel better. You&#8217;ll start to have more energy. You&#8217;ll flash that beautiful smile more. You may even start to smile at the mirror when you put on that cute outfit that makes you feel like a rock star. You can&#8217;t put a label on that type of honest confidence. It doesn’t have to be a monumental goal, it has to be a goal you STICK to.</p>
<h2>One Step Forward</h2>
<p>I know that sometimes, it&#8217;s not easy sticking to plans, and sometimes we fail. I try not to make resolutions, for example. I don&#8217;t say, &#8220;I want to be shredded and lean.&#8221; I like a good tequila and my donuts. If anything, every year I try to recommit to finding more of a work and family balance because usually I work so much. Each of the past 5 years I&#8217;ve set that resolution, and got a big fat zero. And now 2020 fixed that resolution for me, since we&#8217;re all at home, and I&#8217;m not on the road, and I found I enjoy my 30 minute afternoon coffee! Then right back to work sure, but I NEVER GOT THAT! WooHoo!! So you never know where your victories might come from.</p>
<p>I have one piece of advice I give to anyone asking how they can start on the path to a healthier lifestyle — <strong>just start moving</strong>. People ask, &#8220;Should I start with exercise or nutrition?&#8221; If you want the best answer, start with both. But one can also lead to the other.</p>
<p>Say you have a junk food craving. If you get up and go for a walk, often that craving subsides. Without any extra effort, beyond just going for a walk, you&#8217;ve already made a more nutritious decision for your body as you let go of that junk food dream. The more you move, the less you&#8217;re going to crave.</p>
<p>Another thing to do is <strong>break the cycle of sitting</strong>. How often do you sit and say, now I have energy? Never. The more you sit, the more your body wants to sit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3087" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026.jpg" alt="Erin Oprea flexing with Kelsea Ballerini" width="645" height="645" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026.jpg 800w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026-300x300.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026-150x150.jpg 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ad3c786f-926e-4e51-b5d8-b7b67fbb2026-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">One of my clients and close friends, Kelsea Ballerini, adds “Fresh air gives you energy, too. I know it&#8217;s cold. That&#8217;s why we have those amazing layers in the winter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, pull on your coat, grab your gloves, and <strong>just start walking</strong>. Maybe even grab your dog, they’ll love it I swear!</p>
<p>And I always tell my clients to <strong>smile during a workout</strong>, or whenever they move their bodies. Smiling can trick your brain into releasing endorphins which in turn helps you reach your fitness goals more efficiently and helps empower yourself to stick to your goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Movement is a gift. Don&#8217;t look at it as a chore — take advantage of the gift.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And never stop smiling.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[This easy New Year’s resolution is one you’ll actually want to keep – and it’s good for you, too. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>This easy New Year’s resolution is one you’ll </b><b>actually want</b><b> to keep – and it’s good for you</b><b>, too</b><b>.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p>Happy New Year, grinner. (Cue the confetti.) <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/10-top-new-years-resolutions-for-success-happiness-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> shows that about 60% of us make New Year’s resolutions, but only 8% of people achieve them. This year, rather than dropping your New Year’s resolution midway through January, set a resolution you’ll have no trouble keeping: Resolve to smile. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>Smiling is so easy to do yet has so many benefits. Make 2021 the year of sharing the smiles. Besides getting to show off your new smile when we return to a world without masks, here are some reasons why a smile you’ll love will make 2021 the best year yet.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>1. You’ll feel more confident.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Nothing says confidence like a new smile. Studies have shown that smiling can boost your mood on the spot. Plus, people who smile tend to be (or at least appear to be) more confident. SmileDirectClub aligners straighten most smiles in an average of just 4-6 months, so you could be showing off your confident new grin by summer.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>2. You’l</b><b>l save money while gaining said confidence.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Another top New Year’s resolution is to save more money and spend less. Good news for you and your wallet: <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileDirectClub is up to 60% less than traditional braces.</a> Your <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">insurance</a> may help cover treatment, too. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>3. You’ll create good habits.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Wearing aligners holds you accountable when it comes to brushing and flossing after every meal and snack, making it a part of your everyday life. By the time you’re done with treatment, brushing and flossing more will be a part of your routine that will be no sweat to maintain. You’ll also have even more reason to keep up on scheduling your 6-month cleanings with your local dentist. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>4. You’ll be healthier.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Your <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/">dental hygiene</a> will obviously improve with all that brushing and flossing, but there are even more ways you’ll be healthier thanks to your new gorgeous grin. Since you must remove your aligners every time you eat and drink anything other than cool water, you’ll practice more mindful eating by default. Say goodbye to excessive snacking, and use this as an opportunity to plan out healthy snacks and meals. Other popular resolutions are quitting smoking and drinking less – both common side effects of wearing aligners, since you can’t smoke or drink alcohol while wearing aligners. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1720" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/weird-things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners.jpg" alt="things that might happen wearing invisible aligners" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/weird-things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/weird-things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/weird-things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><b>5. You’ll set yourself up for success.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Want to make a good first impression? Smile. Forty-eight percent of adults say a smile is the most memorable feature when they first meet someone, according to a study from Kelton Global. Plus, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597804000743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who smile appear more likable, courteous, and competent.</a> Go ahead and smile during interviews and job negotiations, smile during that big presentation at work, and smile during your next coffee date. You’ll set yourself up for success without even thinking about it.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>6. You’ll make other people feel better, too.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Smiling is contagious, after all. Researchers at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it’s hard to frown when looking at someone else’s smile. We all want to smile – if you’re smiling at someone, they’re likely to smile back. So go on, grinner. Share the smiles, confidence, and happiness with others this year. We guarantee that’s a resolution you’ll want to stick to. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is a flexible spending account (FSA)?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An FSA is a medical savings account that allows you to set aside a portion of your earnings to pay for qualified medical expenses. Money deducted from your paycheck is not subject to payroll taxes, and it’s not taxed when you withdraw it. FSAs are available through your employer, and you need to define the amount of money you’ll contribute to your account for the year during open enrollment. Funds expire at the end of the year, so you need to use them or lose them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is a health savings account (HSA)?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An HSA is a medical savings account available to people who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Funds put into the account aren’t subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit, and you don’t pay any taxes on money you withdraw for medical expenses. With an HSA, even one provided through your employer, the money and the account are yours, and the funds roll over from year to year.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How can I purchase invisible aligners using my HSA or FSA?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a debit card associated with your HSA or FSA account, simply process your payment on our site like you would any credit card. If you have an HSA/FSA without a debit card, give us a call so we can help you process it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does SmileDirectClub take payments through insurance?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your dental plan provides orthodontic benefits, you may be covered for SmileDirectClub aligners. As of November 2020, SmileDirectClub is in network with UnitedHealthCare, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire BlueCross BlueShield. <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more here.</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have a money-back guarantee?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We sure do. If our dentists and orthodontists determine SmileDirectClub isn’t the right fit for you, we will gladly refund your impression kit. If customers decide they aren&#8217;t happy with their aligners, they can return them for a full refund within 30 days of receiving them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I have more questions. Who can I talk to?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our Customer Care and Dental teams are available 24/7, via phone, email, chat, video chat and social media.</p>
<p>Put those FSA funds to work. See if you&#8217;re a candidate for SmileDirectClub invisible aligners by taking our free, 30-second Smile Assessment today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Straightening her smile helped Tiffany finally gain lifelong confidence. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SmileDirectClub customer Tiffany Zubal shares her before and after story and her journey toward lasting confidence.</h2>
<p>If you had told me five years ago that this would be my life, I wouldn’t have believed you. Not only did I not think I deserved my relationships or accomplishments, but I also never believed I could even make those things happen for myself. Let me explain: When I was in the third grade, my parents told me that they were getting divorced. I know that their divorce wasn’t about me, but I still mark it as the first time I felt my confidence waver. I always thought they were totally fine, and the fact that I had missed whatever warning signs made me completely unsure of myself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2027" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tiffany-zubal-smile-direct-club-after.jpeg" alt="" width="788" height="526" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tiffany-zubal-smile-direct-club-after.jpeg 640w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tiffany-zubal-smile-direct-club-after-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t get much easier as I got older. When I started high school, I was super reserved and lived in constant fear of judgment. No matter what I said or did, I was afraid it would be wrong. After a few years of this, I decided to apply for an independent study – thinking it would help me perform better in school – and I ended up finishing high school from home. I graduated a year early, which was great and all, but I still wonder whether I made the right choice. From time to time, I see people who I was acquaintances with in high school, and it reminds me that I don’t really have any friends from that time. On the other hand, being alone forced me to learn to be with – and become good friends with – myself.</p>
<p>I’m 22 years old now. I’ve been married for three years, and my husband and I have a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter named Adeline. A lot of women say their confidence wavers after becoming a parent – I guess they feel that, in a way, they lose a sense of themselves – but for me, it’s been quite the opposite. As soon as I got pregnant with Adeline, I knew that I didn’t want her to feel the way I had felt about myself almost my whole life. I didn’t want her to think, <em>I can’t do that because I’m not smart enough, </em>or <em>I can’t do that because I don’t have friends</em>. In short: I didn’t want what held me back to hold her back, so I gave myself no choice but to go after what I wanted and to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s important to me that she sees me as a confident woman</strong>, so I became very careful not to speak negatively about myself or perpetuate the idea that I wasn&#8217;t good enough. I want her to always know that if you want to do something, you just have to believe in yourself and do it, because otherwise, it’s not going to happen. People can’t do that for you. You have to do it for yourself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2025 size-full" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tiffany-before-and-after.jpg" alt="tiffany before after smile direct club review" width="788" height="790" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tiffany-before-and-after.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tiffany-before-and-after-150x150.jpg 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tiffany-before-and-after-300x300.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Tiffany-before-and-after-768x770.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>To be that strong, confident woman for my daughter, one major thing I had to overcome was my fear of showing people my <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/can-you-straighten-your-teeth-without-braces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teeth</a>. I really tried not to open my mouth much, so I either kept quiet or looked down when I spoke – rarely making eye contact. I know it was probably in my head, but I felt like everybody’s eyes went straight to my teeth. So when I saw a social media ad for <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileDirectClub aligners</a>, I immediately started to figure out how we could swing it. <strong>From start to finish, my teeth were straight in just four months.</strong> Now, I’ve started making eye contact when I talk to people – whether that be to prospective friends, clients at the kids&#8217; hair salon where I’m a manager, or store owners I approach to sell Adeline’s Bow Line, my collection of children&#8217;s clothes and accessories. I don’t know whether it was my confidence coming through or what, but I was able to access my inner positive voices instead of just the negative ones.</p>
<p>Turns out, putting yourself down takes up a lot of brain space, and that limits the room to actually act on your hopes and dreams. It took away the power to go after what I want. When I thought I couldn’t do certain things, I figured there was no reason to try. But when I put myself in the positive mindset of believing that I can, it&#8217;s so much easier to throw caution to the wind and just go for it.</p>
<p>I used to wonder,<em> If I post this <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/take-an-instagram-worthy-after-selfie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-tracker-added="true">selfie</a>, is everybody going to think I’m obsessed with myself? </em>But no, it’s okay. I’m allowed to like myself.<strong> It’s good to be humble, but no one should frown upon people being confident in themselves.</strong> Celebrating myself and my success doesn’t mean I have some sort of perfect life. I just know that even if you don’t feel like you’re enough, it’s worth acting like you are because eventually, you’ll believe it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Show off that new grin with the perfect “after” photo.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Step up your selfie game with these tips, perfect for showing off your new smile.</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve made it to the end of your smile journey, time to celebrate and share your smile with the world – or at least with your friends and family on social media. Show off that new grin with the perfect “after” photo. These 7 tips will help you take an epic selfie to show off your straight, beautiful new smile.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Get the right lighting for your selfie. </strong></h3>
<p>Good lighting is everything. So ideally, you’ll want plenty of natural light to take the perfect selfie. Set up in front of a window so the light is hitting your face – not coming in from behind you. Or head outside. Overcast skies or in the shade is best because direct sunlight can be harsh in photos.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Keep it simple. </strong></h3>
<p>Find a background that isn’t too busy and is free of clutter.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Be yourself.</strong></h3>
<p>Make the moment unique to you and show off your personality. Add a few accessories. Find a cool backdrop. Incorporate a pop of your favorite color. While you don’t want your selfie to be too busy, you still want it to feel authentic to you, so have some fun with it.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Bring in a prop.</strong></h3>
<p>Feeling shy? Pose with your pet. Add a coffee cup. Cameo a cute succulent. A nice prop will add visual interest and ground your shot.</p>
<h3>5. Flash those pearly whites.</h3>
<p>Want to take your confidence game to another level? Use our <strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening to get your teeth to their whitest white. A <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/teeth-whitening-kit-with-led-light-and-6-month-pen-supply" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4-pack of these no-mess whitening pens</a> whiten your teeth in just 1 week, with results lasting 6 months. Pair with the cool blue <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/teeth-whitening-led-accelerator-light" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED accelerator light</a> to speed up the power of our whitening.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Do a similar look as your “before” photo.</strong></h3>
<p>If you plan on doing a side-by-side before and after, keep the two shots consistent. Maybe style your hair a similar way, frame the photo the same, and do a similar beauty look so the focus is on your beautiful new smile – not a dramatic smokey eye or bold lip color.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1845" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/how-to-take-the-perfect-after-selfie-before-afters.gif" alt="how to take the perfect after selfie before afters" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<h3>7. Don&#8217;t over-filter.</h3>
<p>Your teeth are bright and straight. You’re feelin’ yourself. We get it, it’s tempting to go a little overboard on filters. But don’t over-edit your after photo. A drastically filtered photo can easily come off as fake, and that new grin is all real.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to order retainers to preserve that new confident smile. We can help with that.</p>
