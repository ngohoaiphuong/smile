					<description><![CDATA[Add these 10 foods to your diet to help beat bad breath.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;ve got a first date or a big job interview, bad breath — or &#8220;halitosis,&#8221; if you want to get fancy — can make quite a bad impression. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to use your diet to make your bright smile smell better.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2757 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/red-toothbrush.png" alt="red toothbrush" width="407" height="252" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/red-toothbrush.png 988w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/red-toothbrush-300x186.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/red-toothbrush-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></p>
<p>Good <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dental hygiene</a> is the best way to prevent bad breath, but the food you eat can also make a major impact. We all know onions or garlic are a no-no if you&#8217;re looking to kick halitosis to the curb, but what causes bad breath goes deeper than stinky foods. The bacteria in your mouth, rather than the odors in the food itself, produce sulfur compounds responsible for bad breath as they break down leftover food particles and dead cells.</p>
<p>With these simple bad-breath remedies, you can help clear out those bacteria — and be fully prepared to dazzle your date, that job interviewer or anyone else who happens to catch a whiff.</p>

<h1>Foods that fight halitosis</h1>
<h2>1. Raw fruits and veggies</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2698 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fruits-1024x538.png" alt="raw fruits and veggies" width="520" height="273" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fruits-1024x538.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fruits-300x158.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fruits-768x404.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fruits.png 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p>Crunchy fresh fruits and veggies, including apples, pears, carrots and celery, help produce saliva, which cleans out the odor-producing bacteria in your mouth. Plus, they&#8217;re rich in fiber, so they act as natural toothbrushes as you eat. If you opt for apples, you&#8217;ll get a triple dose of bad-breath prevention: A study in the Journal of Food Science found that apples help neutralize the bad-breath odors caused by raw garlic.</p>
<h2>2. Probiotic yogurt</h2>
<p>Yogurt with probiotics contains good bacteria and can help combat the bacteria that is one of the causes of bad breath. A <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-03/iaa-pci030205.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> from the International Associations for Dental Research found that participants who ate three ounces of sugar-free yogurt twice a day for six weeks had lower levels of bacteria-causing compounds.</p>
<h2>3. Parsley and basil</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2701 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/parsley.png" alt="parsley" width="511" height="343" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/parsley.png 907w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/parsley-300x201.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/parsley-768x516.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" /></p>
<p>Both of these herbs contain polyphenols, natural chemicals that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24592995">studies</a> have shown work as bad-breath remedies. They&#8217;re also heavy on chlorophyll (more on that below). If you&#8217;re craving the zest of garlic but don&#8217;t want your mouth to pay the price, parsley and basil make a tasty substitute flavor combination — and a good way to nip halitosis in the bud.</p>
<h2>4. Cherries</h2>
<p>Studies have shown cherries remove the smell of methyl mercaptan, a bad-breath-causing gas that occurs naturally in foods, including onions and some cheeses. Lettuce has the same effect.</p>
<h2>5. Green tea</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3459493/">Studies</a> have shown that catechins, natural antioxidants found in abundance in <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-diet-affects-your-teeth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green tea</a>, can help fight bad-breath-causing bacteria. And like parsley and basil, green tea&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415245/">polyphenols</a> have been found to be highly effective as well.</p>
<h2>6. Sugarless gum</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2704" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gum.png" alt="sugarless gum" width="371" height="246" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gum.png 916w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gum-300x198.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gum-768x508.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /></p>
<p>Chewing gum helps to loosen and remove both food and dead cells from your teeth, which are what bacteria need to create bad breath. Sugar-sweetened gum, though, can promote further dental decay — so try gum sweetened with the natural alternative xylitol.</p>
<h2>7. Melons and citrus</h2>
<p>The healing power of Vitamin C is well-known, and it&#8217;s as effective in your mouth as anywhere else. Citrus fruits, melons and other foods high in Vitamin C help <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/241721.php#causes">prevent halitosis-causing gingivitis</a> and other oral health issues.</p>
<h2>8. Chlorophyll</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2706 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chlorophyll.png" alt="chlorophyll" width="376" height="252" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chlorophyll.png 912w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chlorophyll-300x201.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/chlorophyll-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not technically a food, but you can find this pigment in leafy green vegetables (including some on this list) or in supplement form at your local health food store. Chlorophyll doesn&#8217;t strictly eliminate bad breath, but it does help to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/style/chlorophyll-benefits.html">mask it</a>.</p>
<h2>9. Ginger</h2>
<p>Ginger contains a compound called 6-gingerol, which stimulates an enzyme in our saliva that <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180730120353.htm">helps to break down</a> sulfur compounds in the mouth. Try combining pressed ginger, lemon juice and warm water for an easy, at-home mouth rinse.</p>
<h2>10. Water</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2708 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/water-1024x681.png" alt="water" width="403" height="268" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/water-1024x681.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/water-300x199.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/water-768x510.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/water.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p>This one is easy but crucial. By keeping well-hydrated, you&#8217;ll naturally rinse away food particles and dead cells — and make your mouth a less hospitable breeding ground for breath-causing bacteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bonus: Other ways to prevent bad breath</h2>
<h3>1. Clean your aligners or retainer.</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re here on the SmileDirectClub site, you might have a clear aligner or retainer. And if that&#8217;s the case, keeping it clean is a huge help when trying to fight halitosis. Popping them in your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/smilespa">smile spa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> for 5 minutes or soaking them in gentle liquid soap and water for 20 minutes is a good way to go. Skip the toothpaste, which can damage the plastic. And brush and floss your teeth before each time you put them in.</p>
<h3>2. Brush and floss after snacks.</h3>
<p>Yes, brushing and flossing twice a day keeps your teeth healthy, but twice is just the <em>minimum</em> recommendation. To clean out causes of bad breath all day long, brush and floss after snacks too. Keep a pre-pasted disposable toothbrush and a few floss picks on you wherever you go.</p>
<h2>Transform your smile.</h2>
<p>Of course, fighting off bad breath is just one step towards a healthier, more confident smile. If you&#8217;re ready for a straighter smile you&#8217;ll love, consider <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/">SmileDirectClub aligners.</a> SmileDirectClub aligners cost up to 60% less than traditional braces and eliminate the inconvenience of in-office visits. Plus, the average customer sees results in just six months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tips on brushing, flossing, cleaning your aligners, and improving your overall oral hygiene.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seek no more! We&#8217;ve got the answers to your biggest questions about brushing, flossing, cleaning your aligners, and improving your overall dental hygiene.</p>
<h2>1. What&#8217;s the right way to brush?</h2>
<p>This might seem obvious, but brushing correctly makes a world of difference in keeping your mouth healthy. Experts recommends placing your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/electric-toothbrush">toothbrush</a> at a 45-degree angle and gently brushing back and forth in short strokes for 2 minutes. Brush the outer surfaces, inner surfaces, and spots where you chew. Tilt your brush slightly to brush the inside of your front teeth. Finish by brushing your tongue to keep your breath fresh.</p>
<p>Brush with <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/whitening-toothpaste">fluoride toothpaste</a> at least twice a day, especially in the morning and again at night before bed.</p>
<h2>2. Do I really need to floss?</h2>
<p>Yes! Experts still agree flossing is beneficial, and you should clean between your teeth. We recommend flossing at least once every day. A <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/water-flosser">water flosser</a> can help make this easier.</p>
<h2>3. Should I use mouthwash?</h2>
<p>While not a necessity, we love a good mouthwash to freshen breath and help reach in-between spaces floss might miss. Some mouth rinses can also help prevent or control tooth decay, reduce plaque, and prevent gingivitis. A colored mouthwash might affect your aligners or whitened teeth, so pick a clear or whitening one instead. Find a list of ADA-approved mouth rinses <a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/ada-seal-products/category-display?supercategory=Mouthrinses">here</a>.</p>
<h2>4. How should I store my toothbrush?</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve been storing our toothbrushes in travel cases for years, but according to the <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/about-the-ada/ada-positions-policies-and-statements/statement-on-toothbrush-care-cleaning-storage-and-">ADA</a>, that&#8217;s actually one of the worst places to keep them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A moist environment such as a closed container is more conducive to the growth of microorganisms than the open air.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, store your toothbrush upright (separate from your family members&#8217; or roommates&#8217; toothbrushes) and give it a chance to dry before you use it again.</p>
<h2>5. How often do I need to replace my toothbrush?</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to use a new toothbrush every 3 to 4 months and more often if you&#8217;ve been sick. The more worn-down and frayed the bristles are, the less effective your brush will be at controlling plaque, according to a study from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3455936">Journal of Clinical Periodontology</a>.</p>
<h2>6. How do I clean my aligners?</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re wearing your aligners almost 24/7, they&#8217;re bound to need a little TLC once in a while. We recommend cleaning them every few days to keep them (and your breath) fresh. We prefer to use our <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/smilespa">smile spa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Ultrasonic and UV Cleaning Machine.</a> There are a few other at-home remedies that work well for <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/">cleaning your aligners and retainers</a>. Remember to brush your teeth after eating and before popping your aligners back in. Never use bleach, alcohol, or other harsh cleaning agents. Skip the boiling water, too, which can warp your aligners.</p>
<p>More than half of SmileDirectClub customers report improved dental hygiene after wearing their invisible aligners compared to before they started.</p>
