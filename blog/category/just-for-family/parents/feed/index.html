										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things give one an ego boost like having Hollywood-worthy teeth.</p>
<p>Just ask Addie Sibley, 16. The high school sophomore is flashing a perfect smile after spending just four months in SmileDirectClub aligners. Talk about speed straightening. Addie&#8217;s crowded teeth have transformed into a gorgeous grin in just one semester of high school. She says that most of her friends have braces or another brand of clear aligners, and it took more than a year for their teeth to straighten. &#8220;So they&#8217;re shocked at how fast my teeth improved,&#8221; Addie says.</p>
<p>Her new smile has changed her life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before, when I would be laughing, I would cover my teeth with my hand,&#8221; Addie says. “I would make sure people could only see me from certain angles, and I would always smile with my mouth closed.&#8221; Her days of hiding her teeth are over. “Now I smile with my mouth open, to show my teeth,&#8221; she says.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Family of Brighter (and Affordable) Smiles</h2>
<p>Her brother, Joey, 14, is wearing SmileDirectClub aligners too. He also had crowded teeth that were making him self-conscious. The eighth-grader started in treatment at the same time as Addie and completed treatment in May 2020.</p>
<p>The kids each chose different treatment plans. Addie got SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Clear Aligners, which she wore day and night for a treatment that took less than six months. Joey has Nighttime Clear Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. That means he wears them only at night, so his treatment takes longer (up to 10 months). The reason they took different paths? Addie was interested in finishing her treatment as quickly as possible, but Joey didn&#8217;t want to wear the aligners while playing sports. Both kids found a plan that fit their own priorities and schedule.</p>
<p>Before it all started, the Sibley teens <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/parents/">knew they wanted to do something about their smiles</a>, says their dad, Joe Sibley, an attorney in Austin, Texas. But when he took them to an orthodontist to look into getting braces, the price gave him sticker shock. The price quoted was $7,000 to $8,000 for a two-year treatment plan for both kids, with monthly office visits.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t fit with the family&#8217;s schedule or budget. &#8220;We were at a place of, &#8216;Do we really want to do it?'&#8221; Joe says. Because the only thing more expensive than braces for a teenager is braces for two teenagers.</p>
<p>But then Joe saw a commercial for SmileDirectClub and &#8220;a light went on,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I thought, it&#8217;s probably like everything else, that there&#8217;s an online solution that&#8217;s better than anything you find in a store.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Getting Two Teens Into Aligners</h2>
<p>Joe took Addie and Joey in for the initial 3D scan at a SmileShop in Austin, Texas. “We liked the relaxed feel of the place, and they answered all our questions,&#8221; Joe says. Even better was the price of the SmileDirectClub treatment plan, which was 60% less than traditional braces. &#8220;You could pay for a cruise to Alaska with the money we saved,&#8221; Joe says.</p>
<p>Addie and Joey saw improvements in their teeth as soon as they were done with their first set of aligners. &#8220;My smile looked better after a week,&#8221; Addie says. “You could really see it was moving my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took photos of her teeth three times a month, holding up her phone and snapping selfies to track her progress and stay motivated.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The photos inspired me to keep going,&#8221; she says. “Sometimes I didn&#8217;t want to put the aligners in. But I would look at the photos, see how much better my teeth looked, and keep going.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Addie and Joey say the aligners <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">were uncomfortable at first</a>, but they got used to them. <mark class="" data-mark-id="51932a7b-ccf3-40df-b72d-fbc31d26da06"></mark>Four months in, Joey can already see a difference — and so can his friends, because they&#8217;re telling him how good his teeth are looking. &#8220;It&#8217;s made me feel a lot more confident,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>A Household of Confident Kids</h2>
<p>Joe says he hasn&#8217;t had to be a helicopter dad to make sure the kids wear the aligners because the support they&#8217;ve gotten from SmileDirectClub staff has helped Addie and Joey manage their own treatment. &#8220;It&#8217;s been very user-friendly. We get the reminder emails that go out, telling them when to change the aligners,&#8221; he says. &#8220;To be honest, sometimes I forget (Addie and Joey) have (aligners.) I really don&#8217;t hear anything about them from either of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there have been sacrifices. No gum. No late-night snacks. But straight teeth are worth it. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be ready to try new things now that I feel better about my teeth,&#8221; Addie says. &#8220;My teeth were an insecurity of mine. They were holding me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joey says having straighter teeth is already making him more outgoing. &#8220;I&#8217;m more likely to talk to somebody if I&#8217;m not worried they&#8217;re judging my teeth. I feel a lot more secure about how I look.&#8221; Unlike his peers in braces, Joey doesn&#8217;t want wires glinting in his mouth whenever he speaks. Clear aligners let those straight teeth show sooner.</p>
<p>Joe says he&#8217;s delighted with the difference he sees in his kids&#8217; smiles and lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They have more confidence, and they are more comfortable speaking and smiling,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It makes me feel good as a parent because you want your kids to have all they need to be successful and happy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>College is expensive. SmileDirectClub aren’t. Help your college student</strong><strong> succeed with the gift of new smile.</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve already saved up and shelled out for tuition, room and board, books, and dorm decor. The last thing you want to do is open your wallet again. But if you’re already sending baby bird out of the nest and into the real world, you might as well send them out with confidence. Here are 5 reasons why SmileDirectClub clear aligners are a good investment for your college students.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377122844?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<h3><strong>1. SmileDirectClub is completely doctor-directed.</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doctor-directed</a>, doctor-prescribed <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-things-parents-know-teen-braces-smile-direct-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aligners</a> may be the perfect solution for your teen’s active lifestyle. The custom-made aligners are removable, meaning there are no food restrictions, and keeping teeth clean is a cinch. And a state licensed dentist or orthodontist is with your teen every step of the way, monitoring their progress and making sure their teeth are moving according to plan and will check in remotely.</p>
<p>Plus, our Dental Team is available via video, phone, email, and chat to answer any treatment questions you have. And since SmileDirectClub can be done completely remotely, there are no office visits to worry about missing. But we can&#8217;t make any promises about not missing classes.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Monthly payments are less than your child’s cell phone bill.</strong></h3>
<p>Give them a smile they’ll love for much less than traditional braces. The best part: We work with plenty of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/insurance/">insurance providers</a>, and even accept <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/you-can-use-your-hsa-or-fsa-purchase-your-invisible-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSA, FSA</a>, and <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-does-carecredit-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CareCredit</a>. No credit checks. No forms to fill out.</p>
<h3><strong>3. You&#8217;ll boost their confidence instantly.</strong></h3>
<p>Studies have shown that smiling can boost your mood on the spot. Plus, those who smile tend to be (or at least appear to be) more confident. Help them <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/8-tips-for-wearing-your-invisible-aligners-when-you-head-back-to-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ace the semester in the classroom</a> and beyond with a straight, bright smile they’re truly proud of.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377416282?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<h3><strong>4. SmileDirectClub is safe and effective. </strong></h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligners shift teeth into their desired position in an average of 4-6 months. That means your student could have a new, straight smile by spring break. Don’t just take our word for it. Check out real customer reviews and see their pearly grins <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>5. You’ll help prepare them for job interviews.</strong></h3>
<p>Forty-eight percent of adults think a smile is the most memorable feature after they meet someone for the first time. Not only that, but 25% of survey respondents think someone with crooked or stained teeth is less confident.</p>
<p>While student loans can take years to pay off, the payoff of a new, straight smile happens right away. Get started today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Guest post from Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD</h2>
<h3>SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Lead Dentist, Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD, shares his take on teen aligners.</h3>
<p>Aligners have been available for adults for over a decade, but it wasn’t until recently that doctors began recommending them for teens. In fact, SmileDirectClub helps straighten the teeth of those as young as 12 years old. Aligners are custom-made and designed to shift teeth into a straighter smile you’ll love. And they might be an ideal fit for you and your lifestyle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smiledirectclub.com/smile_assessment">	<p style="text-align: center">
		<a href="https://www.smiledirectclub.com/smile_assessment" class="btn btn--purple">
			See if you&#8217;re a candidate		</a>
	</p>
	</a></p>
<h3><strong>What are aligners?</strong></h3>
<p>Aligners are custom-made, thin plastic coverings or “trays” that fit snugly over your teeth. Their design allows for healthy alignment and looks aesthetically pleasing. If you qualify for SmileDirectClub’s <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/">doctor-directed</a>, clear aligner therapy, you will be sent a series of these <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit/">aligners</a> directly to your home.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll wear each set of aligners for 1–2 weeks, as your doctor prescribes, to shift your teeth slightly. Then you&#8217;ll go on to the next set, which will continue to move them further. Over time, all the small movements will add up to a big change! At the end of your smile plan, we recommend ordering a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/retainer-questions-answered/">retainer</a> to keep your new smile in place for life.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why should I get aligners?</strong></h3>
<p>There are many different types of orthodontic treatment available today. One of the most flexible for your active lifestyle is SmileDirectClub’s aligners. And if you’re a teen or the parent of a teen, SmileDirectClub’s <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/">doctor-directed</a>, doctor-prescribed, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-things-parents-know-teen-braces-smile-direct-club/">aligners</a> may be a perfect solution!</p>
<p>There are two differentiating features of aligners. The first is that they are clear, which means they are very difficult to detect when you are wearing them. The second is that you can take them out when eating or drinking, and most importantly you can take them out to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions">floss and brush your teeth</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>How are aligners different from braces?</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/whats-difference-between-smiledirectclub-and-braces/">Traditional metal braces</a> still work best in some situations – and you might be surprised to find that they&#8217;re still a popular option for many teenagers needing more complex tooth movement! But now that aligners are being designed specifically for teens, more are choosing them every day.</p>
<p>Your aligners are designed to be worn all day and night except when eating and drinking anything other than water. You’re able to take them out for meals or important social occasions. Yet even when you&#8217;re wearing them, it&#8217;s pretty hard for anyone else to tell – a big difference from metal braces.</p>
<p>Aligners make your teeth easier to clean than braces. Because they&#8217;re removable, there&#8217;s nothing to keep you from brushing and flossing everywhere in your mouth, just as you would normally. But brushing and flossing can be much harder to do around the brackets and wires of braces – and oral hygiene often suffers.</p>
<p>Some people also suffer irritation to the cheeks and gums from the metal parts of braces. Fortunately, the plastic of an aligner rarely causes that kind of problem. Plus, you won&#8217;t have to rush into the dental office to quickly fix a protruding wire or reattach a broken bracket. You won&#8217;t have to watch what you eat, either, because you&#8217;ll simply remove the aligners at mealtimes.</p>
<h3><strong>Ready to try SmileDirectClub?</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re a teenager and you would like to improve your smile, consider SmileDirectClub’s aligners as an option. You&#8217;ll love the way your new smile looks. And straight teeth will make it easier for you to keep your teeth clean and improve your oral health!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Here's what you need to know about this alternative to teen braces before getting started.]]></description>

<p>We know you want only the best for your kids – and so do we! Our aligners are an easy, affordable option for teens and adults to give them a smile that will help them radiate confidence.</p>
<h2>What do parents need to know about SmileDirectClub?</h2>
<h3>1. It&#8217;s doctor-directed.</h3>
<h3>2. It&#8217;s affordable.</h3>
<h3>3. It&#8217;s perfect for busy kids.</h3>
<h3>4. It&#8217;s a great option for most kids.</h3>

		<a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smile_assessment" class="btn btn--purple">
			Take the Smile Assessment		</a>
	</p>
	</a></p>
<h3><strong>1. It&#8217;s doctor-directed.</strong></h3>
<p>To start, we have a minimum age requirement of 12 years old, plus all customers must have all permanent teeth present and be in good dental health to get started. A <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state licensed dentist or orthodontist</a> reviews and approved every smile plan and oversees each case to make sure everything is moving along as it should. Another perk: All the extra brushing and flossing with clear aligners makes for <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/?referrer=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">better overall dental hygiene</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>2. It&#8217;s affordable.</strong></h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s break down the costs. Teen braces can be pretty expensive. In-office aligners can require attachments and cost nearly $5000 or more. SmileDirectClub aligners only cost $1950, and we also offer the option of easy monthly payments, so your teen could get the smile they love for only $250 down and less than $89 per month. No credit checks. No forms to fill out. Visit our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pricing page</a> for all the details.</p>
<h3><strong>3. It&#8217;s perfect for busy kids.</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re on the road with traveling sports or sending the kids off to summer camp, you won&#8217;t have to worry about regular office appointments with SmileDirectClub aligners. With our teledentistry model, everything is done under the remote care of a state licensed dentist or orthodontist. We also ship all of the aligners out to you at once, so there&#8217;s no waiting around for your next set of aligners. But this doesn&#8217;t mean you go it alone. You will have regular virtual check-ins with your doctor to see how your teeth are moving, and you can reach out to us at any time of day with any questions along the way. We&#8217;re here for you!</p>
<h3><strong>4. It&#8217;s a great option for most kids.</strong></h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub&#8217;s clear aligners are a great option for most kids. Our aligners are designed for minor to moderate teeth correction, including space between teeth, crowding, rotations, and some bite correction. Get started with a doctor-prescribed, easy-to-use, at-home <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/?w=impr">impression kit</a>, or <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit your local SmileShop</a> for a free 3D image with one of our experienced SmileGuides so their smile can be evaluated by a state licensed dentist or orthodontist in our network. <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about getting started here.</a></p>
<h3><strong>5. It&#8217;s easy.</strong></h3>
<p>You can go into a nearby SmileShop to complete a 3D image in just 30 minutes or get started with a remote impression kit. Once you get started, our treatment plans only take an average of 4-6 months. The aligners are removable, meaning there are no food restrictions, and your teen won&#8217;t have to get them adjusted or wear rubber bands or headgear.</p>
<h3><strong>6. The aligners really are clear. </strong></h3>
<p>Our aligners are made from a durable thermoplastic PET-G that&#8217;s BPA-free and identical to the shape of your teeth. Our aligners are made with Comfort Sense<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology, ensuring that they&#8217;re comfortable. The smooth plastic won&#8217;t irritate cheeks or gums like traditional braces. They&#8217;re clear and discreet, and unlike most aligners, they&#8217;re matte, not shiny, which makes them look more natural and less noticeable because they won&#8217;t reflect light. They also won&#8217;t photobomb high school dance pictures for the next four years.</p>
