										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rainer Dawn did not have time for braces.</p>
<p>Sure, his teeth were crooked. &#8220;My canines stuck out,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People called me &#8216;Sharkboy.&#8217; It was not ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3106" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5.png" alt="Rainer's smile before SmileDirectClub treatment" width="345" height="500" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5.png 660w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5-207x300.png 207w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></p>
<p>But Rainer, now 18, had braces for a few months during his <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/teens/">freshman year</a> of high school. His orthodontist was 45 minutes away, and he wasn&#8217;t always able to make the 90-minute round trip every month for adjustments. He&#8217;d also recently gotten his scuba diving license, was gifted some gear, and had the opportunity to visit family in Indonesia for a long scuba diving trip. Metal braces didn&#8217;t jibe with extended international travel, so he had to choose. He chose the once in a lifetime experience and had the braces taken off.<mark class="" data-mark-id="3bc517e0-81a6-483a-af92-dbb4ce983adc"></mark></p>
<p>By the time Rainer reached his senior year of high school, he hated his teeth. But he still didn&#8217;t want to wear braces. Braces made him look younger, he says, and he wasn&#8217;t having it.</p>
<p>Then Rainer saw a SmileDirectClub ad on Instagram. He clicked through for more information and liked what he saw: straight teeth in months instead of years, with no monthly orthodontist visits, and no metal mouth. And all at less than half the average <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a> of braces.</p>
<h2>He made an appointment that day</h2>
<p>Never one to hesitate, Rainer made an appointment for that day for an initial consultation at a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/">SmileDirectClub office</a> that was 20 minutes away from his home in Santa Cruz, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour and a half later, I was walking into the office in San Jose,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I was just super impressed by the whole experience. I sat down in a fancy waiting room—there was kombucha on tap.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3110" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4.png" alt="Rainer shows off his aligners on a ski trip" width="610" height="420" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4.png 1378w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-300x206.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-1024x704.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>He was sold. He did his <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-image/">3D scan</a> and made a down payment that day. His purple box of standard clear aligners arrived at his door soon afterward. He wore his aligners as directed, at least 22 hours a day. His teeth got straighter after just three weeks of wearing his aligners. &#8220;It was a great feeling to see progress and know that you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Four months later, Rainer had the straight, white teeth he had always wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone from never smiling in photos to having a nice, big, wide smile in all my photos,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s changed the way I interact with people.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>He finished high school with straight teeth</h2>
<p>Rainer couldn&#8217;t believe how <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">easy</a> it was to get straight teeth.</p>
<p>His friends never noticed he was wearing aligners, and the discomfort was manageable. &#8220;It was just an amazing experience from start to finish,&#8221; Rainer says. &#8220;It was really simple to follow the instructions and stick with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He really loved not having to go to the orthodontist every month, like he had done when he had braces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3105" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA.jpg" alt="Rainer flashes his new smile after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="385" height="627" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA.jpg 1216w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-184x300.jpg 184w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-629x1024.jpg 629w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-768x1250.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-944x1536.jpg 944w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></p>
<p>Rainer&#8217;s mother, Erin, loved that he stuck with the plan this time. She had been hesitant to pay for SmileDirectClub aligners, even though they were <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/">affordable</a>, because she had already paid for braces for Rainier—$5,000 worth. She had not been thrilled when he insisted on taking them off so he could travel, but she had supported his decision.</p>
<p>But she was impressed with Rainer&#8217;s initiative in researching SmileDirectClub and then making the initial appointment himself. Even more impressive, Rainer had been working and saving up for a few years, so he was able to pay for the aligners upfront himself. Erin couldn&#8217;t be more proud of Rainer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;He stuck to the SmileDirectClub plan and was right on schedule changing out his aligners,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was gratifying to me to see how disciplined he was.&#8221; She credits SmileDirectClub&#8217;s treatment program with helping Rainer stay on track without her supervision. &#8220;I was impressed with how user-friendly it was,&#8221; she says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sees a change in her son now that his teeth are straight. “He smiles more. He has more confidence in public,&#8221; she says. &#8220;His dating life has improved, too.&#8221; <img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3107" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6.png" alt="Rainer poses in a professional photoshoot, showing off his new smile." width="397" height="594" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6.png 650w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p>Rainer finished his SmileDirectClub treatment plan the day he graduated high school. &#8220;I had worked so hard to get there, and to finish high school with straight teeth was an amazing, magical moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He plans to move to Los Angeles, where he wants to be an actor. &#8220;I really want to give it a shot and try to get into commercial work,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My new smile has made a massive difference in my life. I no longer have to worry about how I look when I smile because I have great teeth, which is just essential for that industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things give one an ego boost like having Hollywood-worthy teeth.</p>
<p>Just ask Addie Sibley, 16. The high school sophomore is flashing a perfect smile after spending just four months in SmileDirectClub aligners. Talk about speed straightening. Addie&#8217;s crowded teeth have transformed into a gorgeous grin in just one semester of high school. She says that most of her friends have braces or another brand of clear aligners, and it took more than a year for their teeth to straighten. &#8220;So they&#8217;re shocked at how fast my teeth improved,&#8221; Addie says.</p>
<p>Her new smile has changed her life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before, when I would be laughing, I would cover my teeth with my hand,&#8221; Addie says. “I would make sure people could only see me from certain angles, and I would always smile with my mouth closed.&#8221; Her days of hiding her teeth are over. “Now I smile with my mouth open, to show my teeth,&#8221; she says.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Family of Brighter (and Affordable) Smiles</h2>
<p>Her brother, Joey, 14, is wearing SmileDirectClub aligners too. He also had crowded teeth that were making him self-conscious. The eighth-grader started in treatment at the same time as Addie and completed treatment in May 2020.</p>
<p>The kids each chose different treatment plans. Addie got SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Clear Aligners, which she wore day and night for a treatment that took less than six months. Joey has Nighttime Clear Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. That means he wears them only at night, so his treatment takes longer (up to 10 months). The reason they took different paths? Addie was interested in finishing her treatment as quickly as possible, but Joey didn&#8217;t want to wear the aligners while playing sports. Both kids found a plan that fit their own priorities and schedule.</p>
<p>Before it all started, the Sibley teens <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/parents/">knew they wanted to do something about their smiles</a>, says their dad, Joe Sibley, an attorney in Austin, Texas. But when he took them to an orthodontist to look into getting braces, the price gave him sticker shock. The price quoted was $7,000 to $8,000 for a two-year treatment plan for both kids, with monthly office visits.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t fit with the family&#8217;s schedule or budget. &#8220;We were at a place of, &#8216;Do we really want to do it?'&#8221; Joe says. Because the only thing more expensive than braces for a teenager is braces for two teenagers.</p>
<p>But then Joe saw a commercial for SmileDirectClub and &#8220;a light went on,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I thought, it&#8217;s probably like everything else, that there&#8217;s an online solution that&#8217;s better than anything you find in a store.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Getting Two Teens Into Aligners</h2>
<p>Joe took Addie and Joey in for the initial 3D scan at a SmileShop in Austin, Texas. “We liked the relaxed feel of the place, and they answered all our questions,&#8221; Joe says. Even better was the price of the SmileDirectClub treatment plan, which was 60% less than traditional braces. &#8220;You could pay for a cruise to Alaska with the money we saved,&#8221; Joe says.</p>
<p>Addie and Joey saw improvements in their teeth as soon as they were done with their first set of aligners. &#8220;My smile looked better after a week,&#8221; Addie says. “You could really see it was moving my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took photos of her teeth three times a month, holding up her phone and snapping selfies to track her progress and stay motivated.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The photos inspired me to keep going,&#8221; she says. “Sometimes I didn&#8217;t want to put the aligners in. But I would look at the photos, see how much better my teeth looked, and keep going.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Addie and Joey say the aligners <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">were uncomfortable at first</a>, but they got used to them. <mark class="" data-mark-id="51932a7b-ccf3-40df-b72d-fbc31d26da06"></mark>Four months in, Joey can already see a difference — and so can his friends, because they&#8217;re telling him how good his teeth are looking. &#8220;It&#8217;s made me feel a lot more confident,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>A Household of Confident Kids</h2>
<p>Joe says he hasn&#8217;t had to be a helicopter dad to make sure the kids wear the aligners because the support they&#8217;ve gotten from SmileDirectClub staff has helped Addie and Joey manage their own treatment. &#8220;It&#8217;s been very user-friendly. We get the reminder emails that go out, telling them when to change the aligners,&#8221; he says. &#8220;To be honest, sometimes I forget (Addie and Joey) have (aligners.) I really don&#8217;t hear anything about them from either of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there have been sacrifices. No gum. No late-night snacks. But straight teeth are worth it. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be ready to try new things now that I feel better about my teeth,&#8221; Addie says. &#8220;My teeth were an insecurity of mine. They were holding me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joey says having straighter teeth is already making him more outgoing. &#8220;I&#8217;m more likely to talk to somebody if I&#8217;m not worried they&#8217;re judging my teeth. I feel a lot more secure about how I look.&#8221; Unlike his peers in braces, Joey doesn&#8217;t want wires glinting in his mouth whenever he speaks. Clear aligners let those straight teeth show sooner.</p>
<p>Joe says he&#8217;s delighted with the difference he sees in his kids&#8217; smiles and lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They have more confidence, and they are more comfortable speaking and smiling,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It makes me feel good as a parent because you want your kids to have all they need to be successful and happy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Alexandria is no stranger to challenges, so letting her smile hold her back was not an option.</h2>
<p class="headline-field js-story-headline js-commentable">For a beauty pageant contestant, a great smile can be as important as stage presence, self-confidence, and rhinestones.</p>
<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>Alexandria Hodnik had just started entering pageants around her native Staten Island, New York, and won the Miss Teen North America title when she realized her less-than-perfect smile might keep her from winning more crowns. &#8220;I had an overbite,&#8221; says the 19-year-old. &#8220;My right-top-front tooth was pushed out, and my bottom tooth was pushing all the way back. It was noticeable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexandria had already overcome a lot. The beauty queen has Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, a form of autism. Entering pageants was a way for her to overcome the shyness and anxiety that comes with Asperger&#8217;s by building public speaking skills and confidence. And while she&#8217;d achieved those goals, she was now self-conscious about her smile — a huge liability on the pageant circuit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2876 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-216x300.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="636" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-216x300.jpg 216w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-739x1024.jpg 739w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-768x1065.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider.jpg 1079w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I smiled with my mouth closed, and I was hesitant to smile,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was awkward, and it wasn&#8217;t showing my personality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Braces were a no-go</h2>
<p>Her mother, Carolyn Gardner, looked into getting braces for Alexandria but decided against them. Alexandria has entered six pageants in two years. Besides the busy schedule that comes with pageant life, a doctor&#8217;s office visit a month would have been too much for her, Carolyn says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we go to a doctor or dentist&#8217;s office, Allie gets very anxious,&#8221; Carolyn says. &#8220;She worries for days leading up to it. I didn&#8217;t think she would be a good candidate for a couple of years of monthly appointments in an office.&#8221; Plus, Carolyn&#8217;s own memories of braces weren&#8217;t positive. She wore metal bands on her teeth for three years that left them damaged, she says. &#8220;I remember feeling like a nerd, with all that metal in my mouth,&#8221; she says.</p>
<h2>SmileDirectClub gave her fast results</h2>
<p>Alexandria began her smile journey with SmileDirectClub, where she got started using their telehealth platform. Her mom saw a TV commercial, and they decided to check it out. She did her 3D scan at the SmileDirectClub office in Staten Island and started wearing her SmileDirectClub clear aligners in the summer of 2019. She felt better about her teeth almost immediately.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2869 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-292x300.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="554" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-292x300.jpg 292w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-998x1024.jpg 998w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-768x788.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;She stopped covering her mouth when she smiled,&#8221; Carolyn says. &#8220;She was much happier.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexandria went back to the SmileDirectClub office just once, to check the fit of the first set of aligners. Her treatment was overseen remotely by one of SmileDirectClub&#8217;s state-licensed dentists and she completed virtual check-ins with them along the way. She wore her aligners as prescribed by her doctor and saw her smile improve with each step.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub&#8217;s clear aligners let Alexandria keep modeling, something she couldn&#8217;t have done with a mouthful of metal braces. The aligners didn&#8217;t show, and she could take them out during a photo shoot. &#8220;They totally fit my activities as a model,&#8221; Alexandria says.</p>
<h2>And the award for great teeth goes to &#8230;</h2>
<p>Alexandria&#8217;s treatment took just six months. Once she was out of her aligners, she whitened her teeth with SmileDirectClub&#8217;s whitening kit, and the benefits of her gleaming, new smile were immediate. Alexandria won Miss Photogenic in the Teen North American pageant and the interview award in a second pageant. &#8220;I was so much happier with my smile, and it showed,&#8221; Alexandria says. &#8220;I have confidence in my mouth. My smile is better, and I love it. I like showing my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2872 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-167x300.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="765" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-167x300.jpg 167w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-768x1381.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-854x1536.jpg 854w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>Her teeth will get her more than pageant prizes, though. Alexandria has an eye to a career in beauty, so she enrolled at the College of Staten Island, where she studies business. She wants to be a professional makeup artist and launch her own cosmetics line. Just like any challenge life has thrown her way, she&#8217;s ready to take it on without fear. But now, she has the added confidence of her new smile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;If you feel good about the way you look, your whole life gets better,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I realize that every time I smile and people tell me how good my teeth look. I want to make people feel good about themselves, too.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Prom and graduation season is here. These pro tips will help you capture all the best moments.</h2>



<p>Prom photos and graduation pictures last a lifetime. Think about it, grinner, you&#8217;ll be showing these to your kids and grandkids one day. No pressure or anything.</p>



<p>We turned to our in-house photographer to get some expert tips for nailing your prom and graduation photos, so you can show them off with a smile for years to come. This a moment you&#8217;ll want to remember.</p>



<h3>1. Whiten your teeth the week before.</h3>



<p>The days leading up to prom or graduation are packed with appointments, assignments, and exams. During all that studying, you can whiten your smile easily at home with <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-to-use-bright-on-premium-teeth-whitening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bright on&#x2122; premium teeth whitening (opens in a new tab)"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening</a>. Just once in the morning and once in the evening get your teeth to their whitest white in 1 week without disrupting everyday life, so you’ll be ready for your close-up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="788" height="525" class="wp-image-2510" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures.jpg" alt="bright on prom pictures" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" />
<figcaption><em>Photos by </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sheriivxi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sheriza &quot;Riz&quot; Rahman  (opens in a new tab)"><em>Sheriza &#8220;Riz&#8221; Rahman </em></a></figcaption>
</figure>



<h3>2. Find a good spot out of direct sunlight.</h3>



<p>Nothing will cast a shadow over your <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smiledirectclub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)">Instagram</a> like direct sunlight overhead. Look for a shady spot where you can snap the perfect shot for social media. You can always brighten your photo, but it’s trickier to pull out all the shadows and still maintain good photo quality.</p>



<h3>3. Play up props.</h3>



<p>If you’re not sure what to do with your hands, hold up your diploma, show off your corsage or boutonniere, or playfully grab hold of your dress or jacket and strike a pose. Interacting with some sort of prop will look the most natural and help give off confidence and excitement.</p>



<h3>4. Smile big.</h3>



<p>Congrats, grad, you did it. Show off those pearly whites with confidence, because you earned this photo op. All that&#8217;s left to do is wait for the likes to start rolling in – and maybe start packing for college.</p>



<p>Shop <strong>bright on</strong> here to get photo-ready fast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Cassie and her dad (aka Selfie Dad) both became web superstars. But she wouldn’t show her smile until she had invisible aligners sent directly to her. Now, neither of them can stop grinning.</strong></h2>
<p>Remember #SelfieDad? The photos that <a href="https://people.com/bodies/dad-of-washington-teen-striking-a-pose-to-mimic-her-provocative-selfies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went viral</a> a few years ago when dad <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therealburrmartin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burr Martin</a> started re-creating his daughter <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cassiehorror/">Cassie</a>’s selfies and sharing them on social media?</p>
<p>Burr copied Cassie’s selfies down to the outfits, tattoos, poses, piercings, and more, spending hours penning the tattoos to get the perfect shot – all in an effort to scare off the boys who were commenting on her pics.</p>
<p>More than 200,000 followers and thousands on thousands of Instagram likes later, the famous #SelfieDad and daughter duo are still smiling – with a little help from <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileDirectClub</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1889 alignnone" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smiledirectclub-selfie-dad.gif" alt="smiledirectclub selfie dad and daughter" width="788" height="530" /></p>
<p>What the world didn’t notice about Cassie was that she never actually showed her smile in her selfies. Her dad didn&#8217;t notice it either. Until one day when Cassie came home from work and told him about how she overheard a group of girls making fun of her smile. Burr had seen SmileDirectClub ads and decided to give Cassie the gift of a smile she could be proud of.</p>
<p>“At that point, I didn’t have a choice. You can’t hear, ‘Oh, look at her teeth’ and not do something,” Burr says. He thought, “I have to do something, I have to do something now, and here’s something I can get going right away.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1884 alignnone" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before.jpg" alt="smiledirectclub cassie selfie dad before" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Why Selfie Dad Chose SmileDirectClub</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>It’s affordable.</strong></h4>
<p>When Burr was researching teeth straightening options, SmileDirectClub stood out to him because of the price, which is up to 60% less than traditional braces.</p>
<p>“I can’t afford a used car, so braces were out,” he says.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub offers <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 easy ways to pay for invisible aligners</a>.</p>
<p>“Once you start getting into what do you make a year and your insurance plans and all that, numbers start spinning in my head,” Burr says. “But this was like here, sign up, do this. Okay, done. It was very easy.”</p>
<h4><strong>It’s easy.</strong></h4>
<p>After deciding on SmileDirectClub, Burr went online and ordered Cassie an <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impression kit</a>, which she did right in her own bathroom – no dentist visit necessary. Cassie says,</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was super simple. I wanted to get it done right away, and it was just instant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligners are sent directly to you. We work with a network of over <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state licensed dentists and orthodontists</a> who oversee every case without monthly office visits, waiting rooms, and awkward appointments.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to go in anywhere, it just gets mailed to me, which I like,” Cassie says. “I don’t like going in and someone telling me how crappy my teeth are. I like knowing it myself and fixing it.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1887 alignnone" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before-toss.jpg" alt="smiledirectclub selfie dad and daughter" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before-toss.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before-toss-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-before-toss-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h4><strong>It builds confidence. </strong></h4>
<p>Three months into her smile journey, Cassie posted her first <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/take-an-instagram-worthy-after-selfie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selfie</a> with a big, toothy grin.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize all through this whole selfie thing that every time she smiled she was hiding it, or doing just the lips, or sticking a tongue out,” Burr says. “It was like a lightning bolt. Like, oh my gosh, she’s really smiling with her teeth. It brought a lot of confidence back to her, which was a huge deal.”</p>
<p>“Now I can wear lipstick again,” Cassie says. “I never used to wear lipstick because I didn’t want to draw attention toward my mouth, but now I wear bright red lipstick and I feel super confident in it.”</p>
<p>What’s even better than rocking bright red lipstick? Laughing without thinking what you look like doing it.</p>
<p>“This tooth was so bad that I would be afraid of laughing,” Cassie says, pointing to her smile and showing how she used to cover her mouth every time she laughed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Now I can throw my head back and laugh and don’t feel super insecure, which is nice.”</p></blockquote>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1885 alignnone" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie.jpg" alt="smiledirectclub selfie dad cassie" width="788" height="506" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-300x193.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-cassie-768x493.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>Cassie wasn’t the only one who felt good after finishing her smile plan.</p>
<p>“I felt really good about it because I did something right, and that was great because that doesn’t happen a lot,” Burr says.</p>
<blockquote><p>“She was famous for her selfies and smiling, but it wasn’t really a smile that it should’ve been. How different would that have been if she was actually using all of her teeth smiling?”</p></blockquote>
<p>But now both Burr and Cassie will be smiling – and selfie-ing – for years to come.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1886 alignnone" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-1.jpg" alt="smiledirectclub selfie dad and daughter" width="788" height="546" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-1.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-1-300x208.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/smile-direct-club-1-768x532.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Debunking the most common misconceptions about clear aligners.</h2>
<p>There are a ton of misconceptions out there about straightening teeth with clear aligners. Yes, a doctor is involved, and yes,<strong> aligners are completely safe</strong>.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub is the pioneer of doctor-directed, remote clear aligner therapy, and we’ve helped more than 1 million happy grinners smile confidently. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>Now let’s chomp some myths about clear aligners, shall we?<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377398094?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>

<h3><b>Aligner Myth #1: Everyone will know I’m wearing aligners.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligners are clear and don&#8217;t require attachments or brackets, so it won&#8217;t be obvious that you&#8217;re even wearing them. Plus, our aligners have a slightly matte finish so they don’t reflect light. Chances are, no one will even notice you’re wearing them.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span> <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3><b>Aligner Myth #2: </b><b>You’ll have to comply with</b><b> food restrictions.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Because clear aligners are removable, there are no food restrictions. You can eat whatever you want, even apples and popcorn. Just be sure to always remove your aligners before eating and drinking anything other than cool water. And always brush and floss after eating before putting your aligners back in. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Aligner Myth #3: No doctor is involved. </b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>We utilize a teledentistry platform, which means our 250+ state licensed dentists and orthodontists can oversee Club members&#8217; treatment remotely, eliminating the need for monthly in-office visits.

<h3><b>Aligner Myth #4: They’re inconvenient.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>

					<description><![CDATA[Back-to-school hacks to help you ace the semester with SmileDirectClub.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Back-to-school hacks to help you ace the semester with SmileDirectClub aligners.</h2>
<p>Whether you’re heading off to college for the first time or back to the hallowed halls of high school once again, wearing aligners at school is easy. There’s no reason you can’t enjoy late-night trips to the neighborhood diner, date parties with your campus crush, or weekends on the road with your sports team. These 8 easy tips will keep you grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<h3>1. Be ready to avoid potentially awkward situations.</h3>
<p>At some point in time the professor will bring in coffee and donuts, or the teacher will order pizza for class, someone will bring in an allergy-friendly treat to share, etc. No worries; you can eat whatever you want wearing aligners. This is your time to sneak off to the bathroom with your case to discreetly remove your aligners, or save a treat to take home with you for later. Don’t forget to stop by the bathroom again after class for a quick brush and to pop your aligners back in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2423" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bridesmaids.gif" alt="bridesmaids" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/120B9ojZynuKKA/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>2. Get a quality bag for your essentials.</h3>
<p>Invest in a cosmetics case or small bag that you can stash in your backpack. Having a bag with you makes it quick and easy to clean your mouth and aligners after meals, drinks, and snacks.</p>
<h3>3. Chew on Movemints.</h3>
<p>Going to a dance or date party? You can chew on these dental mints while wearing your aligners. They’ll keep your breath fresh and clean, helping you feel confident all night long. Plus, they help give your aligners a tighter and more comfortable fit. You can<a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/"> stay stocked up on mints</a> by ordering directly through our website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1730" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/back-to-school-aligners-demi.gif" alt="wearing aligners at school" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/p2qsWFW2aM30k/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3> 4. Only drink (cool) water with your aligners in.</h3>
<p>This could be a tricky one for coffee connoisseurs – even worse if you depend on a strong cup of joe to get you through your work day. Rather than sipping on your cold foam cappuccino slowly all morning, we suggest drinking it with breakfast and then cleaning your teeth immediately after. (And stick to 1 or 2 games of flip cup on the weekend – if you’re over 21, of course.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2421" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/twins.gif" alt="drinking water" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2S03OiGhhUXpII/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>5. Use mild dish soap to clean ‘em.</h3>
<p>Aligners are easy to clean, too. A mild dish soap or a mixture of water and baking soda does the trick. Pop your aligners in the cleaning solution or into your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/smilespa">smile spa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> while you get ready in the morning.</p>
<h3>6. Schedule regular dental visits every 6 months.</h3>
<p>Our aligners are completely doctor-directed. Every SmileDirectClub customer is assigned a state licensed dentist or orthodontist who remotely monitors their progress. We&#8217;ll schedule virtual check-ins with your doctor to monitor your progress. It’s also important to continue seeing your local dentist every 6 months for regular cleanings. Schedule those visits now so you don’t forget to go when you’re back home over breaks.</p>
<h3>7. Munch on healthy snacks.</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with the occasional Cheetos and Oreos – sans aligners – but if you want to boost your oral health (and avoid the freshman 15), pick the right snacks. The calcium in almonds can help strengthen your teeth, while the malic acid in strawberries can help whiten your teeth’s enamel and may even protect against oral cancer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1712" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ron-1.gif" alt="" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/X16zGX3XLvLe8/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>8. Bring your aligner case with you everywhere.</h3>
<p>Do not, we repeat do not, wrap your aligners in a napkin while eating in the dining hall. The napkin will inevitably end up in the garbage, along with your cherished aligners. Your SmileDirectClub blurple aligner case will be your new best friend.</p>
<p>In just 4-6 months, a straighter, brighter smiles could be yours. Get a smile you&#8217;ll love by spring break. Click the link below to start your smile journey.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Her twin sister wore traditional metal braces, while Ashlyn got a smile she loves with invisible aligners. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>While her twin sister wore braces, Ashlyn got a smile she loves with aligners.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p>Keesha was looking for fun ideas on Pinterest one day when she came across SmileDirectClub. She was instantly intrigued.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>The mom of 3 girls took her then-12-year-old twin daughters for a consultation at their local <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-do-doctors-really-think-about-invisible-aligners-for-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orthodontist</a>. Ashlyn had some front crowding, which would require a short treatment plan. She didn&#8217;t have any bite issues, and she wouldn&#8217;t need to wear rubber bands with braces. Yet her treatment plan was going to cost just as much as her twin sister&#8217;s 2-year stint with braces: US$6,180.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Keesha remembered that SmileDirectClub is completely doctor-directed and up to 60% less than traditional braces (yes, 60%), so after that orthodontist appointment, she decided to take Ashlyn to a SmileShop instead.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Ashlyn completed her smile plan last November, and today she&#8217;s proud to show off her beautiful new grin. We chatted with Ashlyn and her mom to get the scoop on her SmileDirectClub experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1991" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces.jpg" alt="" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><b>Thanks for sharing you</b><b>r SmileDirectClub review with us! </b><b>K</b><b>eesha, h</b><b>ow </b><b>did you choose SmileDirectClub for Ashlyn but braces for her twin sister?</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Keesha, mom: </b>I sought quotes for traditional braces and aligners at an orthodontist&#8217;s office for both of my daughters. Addison needed more extensive treatment, and traditional braces were a better plan for her. She needed bite correction and would have to wear rubber bands.  <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Ashlyn had a simpler plan, requiring a shorter treatment time, yet was quoted the same price for treatment as her sister. After her appointment I called SmileDirectClub and scheduled a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-scan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free in-person </a>visit at the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago SmileShop</a>. It was an almost 3-hour drive, but if she was a candidate for SDC, it would definitely be worth the day trip to save money. Within 24 hours we had her projected smile plan! We were thrilled – it matched what we were shown during our visit to our local orthodontist office!  <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b>Ashlyn, daughter: </b>My mom took me to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg2-M_vNr30&amp;t=27s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileShop</a>. The shop was really cool, and the woman who scanned my teeth was great about explaining what she was doing. I got to watch the 3D rendering of my teeth on the screen. I left with some cool free SDC stuff, too!<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1990" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club.jpg" alt="" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><b>Walk us through what your experience was like.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Ashlyn:</b> I didn&#8217;t feel or look different while wearing my aligners. The first few hours after putting in a new set of aligners, my teeth were a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/do-invisible-aligners-hurt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little sore</a>, but after that I practically forgot I was even wearing them.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>No one even knew I had the aligners in!<b><i> </i></b>Only those who saw me taking them out knew I was wearing them. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b>Keesha: </b>Ashlyn was told what would be expected of her and that the results were dependent on her following the plan and wearing the aligners as required. She totally complied with her plan.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>I think getting a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D image of your teeth</a> is a great option. Every set of Ashlyn&#8217;s aligners snapped into place with no need for dental wax and no cut-up gums. I&#8217;m pretty sure no one ever noticed her wearing the aligners either. They fit so well, and she never had issues with speaking. She was great about brushing after lunch at school and carried disposable toothbrushes with her in case she needed one when we were out. Ashlyn has been in her retainers for a few months now, and she has a beautiful smile!<b> </b>Seeing her smile full of confidence is all I as a parent can ask for. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><b>Ashlyn: </b>Haha! Every 4 to 6 weeks, she goes in to have her braces adjusted, while I would just pop in a new set of aligners every 2 weeks. I started my 7-month smile plan after her and have completed my treatment. She doesn&#8217;t even know when she&#8217;ll get hers off.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><b>Ashlyn: </b>No! I play volleyball and sing in choir at school. Wearing my aligners didn&#8217;t interfere with my activities at all. Even wearing them while giving presentations in class didn&#8217;t cause any issues. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

If parents find their child is a candidate for SDC, it is a great, affordable option to traditional braces.

<p><b>Ashlyn: </b>It was a quick and simple process.
