<p>Smile Direct Club’s CFO Kyle Wailes joined Yahoo! Finance Live to discuss the Company’s quarterly earnings results for Q4 2020 and long-term strategy for growth.</p>
<p><iframe width="840" height="472.5" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdka9NBnyYs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In his interview, Wailes outlines several key initiatives that the Company is focused on to address its enormous untapped market potential around the world.</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><b>Growing the Smile Direct Club Partner Network</b></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2020, Smile Direct Club launched its <u><a tabindex="-1" title="https://smiledirectclub.com/partner-network/" href="https://smiledirectclub.com/partner-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Network</a></u> to give consumers the option to get started directly from a dentist chair and doctors the option to offer Smile Direct Club aligner therapy to their patients. The company has since grown the Partner Network to include 1,000+ affiliated practices with partnerships with Smile Brands, DECA Dental, and more.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><b>Expanding internationally </b></li>
</ol>
<p>Smile Direct Club is a global oral care leader with a presence in 12 markets around the globe. An estimated 85% of people worldwide could benefit from orthodontic care, yet less than 1% receive it each year, with cost being the biggest issue. Smile Direct Club has plans to launch in additional markets throughout the year.</p>
<p><i>(Source: An independent study. Data on file at Smile Direct Club.)</i></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><b>Growing Smile Direct Club Teen</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The Company launched an offering specifically for Teens in 2020 and will continue to increase its efforts to grow its share of orthodontia’s largest market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At SmileDirectClub, our experts have always been ready to guide you on your smile journey.</p>
<p>Whether you have a question about how your aligner fits or when to swap out an aligner, our team is always available for online chats, emails, video chats, and phone calls.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3050 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-264_blog.jpg" alt="" width="616" height="361" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-264_blog.jpg 860w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-264_blog-300x176.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-264_blog-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px" /></p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re able to be more than guides you can call when needed—we&#8217;re your smile journey navigators. The new SmileDirectClub app gives you personalized guidance and more control over your treatment process so you can stay on track and get through your treatment as easily as possible. Wherever you and your phone go, SmileDirectClub goes, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like having a doctor—and a cheerleader—in your pocket.</p>
<p>The iOS app launched for US customers in October 2020 and covers everything you need to know to get a straighter, brighter smile on the go. The SmileDirectClub app will take you by the hand and lead you through your treatment, from the day you open your blurple box of aligners to the day you unveil your new, confident smile.</p>
<p><strong>Your Smile Journey Navigator<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3058 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-MVP-App-Welcome-Push-SWRVE-Alert1.png" alt="" width="324" height="702" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-MVP-App-Welcome-Push-SWRVE-Alert1.png 750w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-MVP-App-Welcome-Push-SWRVE-Alert1-139x300.png 139w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-MVP-App-Welcome-Push-SWRVE-Alert1-473x1024.png 473w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-MVP-App-Welcome-Push-SWRVE-Alert1-709x1536.png 709w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /></strong></p>
<p>Staying on track with your treatment has never been easier. The SmileDirectClub app frees you from circling dates on your calendar and counting weeks on your fingers—we can be your official smile journey timekeeper instead.</p>
<p>Every time you open the app, you&#8217;ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The details of your treatment plan, including which aligner you are on and how many more you have to go</li>
<li>The date you need to switch aligners</li>
<li>How many days remain in your treatment</li>
<li>Your New Smile ETA: the exact date your treatment ends and your new grin begins</li>
</ul>
<p>The info is live and updates automatically, so you also know what mile marker you are at on the road to a better smile.</p>
<p>Best of all, you can get push reminders via text or notifications telling you when to switch or check your aligners. You&#8217;ll never miss changing your aligners again. Which means you&#8217;ll get the most out of your treatment—without having to stay glued to your calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Answers at Your Fingertips</strong></p>
<p>The SmileDirectClub app also gives you the info you need about your treatment, whenever you need it and wherever you are. Smile expertise is no longer something you only seek out when you&#8217;re having an issue, but helpful, accessible info you can engage with throughout your smile journey.</p>
<p>The app is packed with useful information. There are tips for making your aligners comfortable and a primer on your SmileDirectClub clear aligner tools—from the Outie Tool to Movemints—explaining what they are and how to use them.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3059 alignleft" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-App-MVP-Support-Main.png" alt="" width="331" height="640" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-App-MVP-Support-Main.png 748w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-App-MVP-Support-Main-155x300.png 155w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SDC-App-MVP-Support-Main-530x1024.png 530w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" />There are also answers to typical first-time questions about aligners—questions you may never know you have until the aligners are in your mouth. Because for most people, your smile journey is a brand new experience; sometimes you don&#8217;t know what you need to ask until you really need the answer. No worries. Everything you need to know is waiting for you in the app.</p>
<p>You can even find out what to do when the question is a big one—like, &#8220;Oh no! I lost my aligners!&#8221; Don&#8217;t sweat it. Our in-app Aligner Guide is ready to walk you through next steps and get you back on track. With the app, you&#8217;re never alone on your smile journey.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t find your question? SmileDirectClub has that covered, too. You can chat live, within the app, with a member of our Customer Care or Dental teams and tell them what you need. They&#8217;ll get it handled.</p>
<p>The SmileDirectClub app is a great way to stay tuned in to your SmileDirectClub treatment—so you get the straight teeth you&#8217;ve been waiting for. Club members in the United States can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smiledirectclub/id1528221768">download the app now in the App Store</a>. The app for Android will launch 2021. We’re always working on new app features, so be on the lookout for more cool experiences to help you along your smile journey. Keep smiling, grinner, you got this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often, Veterans face many challenges to reenter the civilian workforce successfully.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not always obvious to employers how skills learned in the military translate into private-sector jobs. As a result, veterans are more likely to be underemployed than others in the workforce—working jobs that are below their skill level or unsuited to their abilities. And when they&#8217;re underemployed, they&#8217;re more likely to leave a job within the first or second year, preventing them from building a career or financial stability.<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2990 alignleft" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-10.51.11-AM-300x236.png" alt="" width="433" height="340" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-10.51.11-AM-300x236.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-10.51.11-AM-1024x804.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-10.51.11-AM-768x603.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-10.51.11-AM-1536x1206.png 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-09-at-10.51.11-AM.png 1684w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Operation Stand Down Tennessee (OSDTN), a Nashville-based nonprofit dedicated to helping veterans manage career, personal, and financial needs, is launching the Veteran Fellowship Program (VFP). The VFP will provide job training, internships, and education to veterans to ease their transition from military member to civilian. The VFP is funded in part with a SuperGrant from SmileDirectClub and the Nashville Predators Foundation.</p>
<p>Former military members make great employees; they just need help finding a private-sector career that uses their skills and makes them feel fulfilled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;In the first year on a private-sector job, 40% of veterans leave,&#8221; says Eden Murrie, CEO of OSDTN. &#8220;In the second year, 80% leave. That&#8217;s a staggering statistic and it makes employers hesitant to hire vets. That&#8217;s what VFP is going to address. We&#8217;re trying to stem that attrition rate by getting the vets to think long-term about what they want to do, to think about their next career versus their next job.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Classroom Learning + On-The-Job Training</h2>
<p>The VFP will launch in January 2021 with a group of six veterans who will each work a five-month paid internship at a Nashville business while taking classes in business fundamentals at Belmont University&#8217;s Jack C. Massey College of Business.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2987 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OSDT-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="390" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OSDT-300x300.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OSDT-150x150.jpg 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OSDT.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /></p>
<p>The Belmont classes will be based on the university&#8217;s mini MBA program, Murrie says, but will be tailored to meet veterans&#8217; needs. The veterans will go to three hours of class each week for 14 weeks to learn the basics of accounting, marketing, and inventory management. They&#8217;ll also attend seminars, panels, learning labs, and events designed to teach them about the private sector business world.</p>
<p>The six veterans will also work 32 hours a week in paid fellowships, where they will get on-the-job training. The employers who will hire and train the vets include SmileDirectClub, the Nashville Predators, Stansell Electric Company, and OSDTN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll have an academic piece and an on-the-job piece. It&#8217;s a recipe for career success that has been shown to work.&#8221; Murrie says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The Department of Labor says one of the best ways to reintegrate vets into the workforce is with apprenticeships and fellowships,&#8221; Murrie says. &#8220;They expose the employer to the benefits the veteran brings to a workforce, and they expose the veteran to what it means to work in the civilian world.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Nashville&#8217;s Full Of Veterans</h2>
<p>The program is open to any veteran who served post 9-11, but it focuses on vets who served 10 to 12 years. There are no educational requirements, and applicants will have all of their program costs covered.</p>
<p>The VFP is also open to spouses of veterans. Spouses have a 24% unemployment rate, triple the national average—due to the frequent relocations that come with being married to a service member.</p>
<p>Once the VFP is up and running, two groups of 12 veterans will be selected for the program annually. &#8220;We want the cohorts big enough so that they learn from each other, but small enough so they have a tight network,&#8221; Murrie says. That&#8217;s because the lack of a professional network is another reason vets struggle in the private sector, she says.</p>
<p>The need for the VFP in Nashville is great because there are so many veterans in the city. Murrie says 300 veterans transition every month out of Fort Campbell, the army installation 60 miles northwest of the city, and a third of them stay in the greater Nashville area. On top of that, Murrie says, 80 vets a month move into middle Tennessee.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2995 size-large" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Veteran-Staff-2020_3-1024x525.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Veteran-Staff-2020_3-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Veteran-Staff-2020_3-300x154.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Veteran-Staff-2020_3-768x394.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Veteran-Staff-2020_3-1536x787.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Veteran-Staff-2020_3-2048x1050.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;We want our program to take Nashville from being vet-friendly to vet-ready,&#8221; Murrie says.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>SuperGrants for a Stronger Community</h4>
<p>SmileDirectClub teamed up with the Nashville Predators Foundation in the 2019-2020 hockey season for the SuperGrant program. The duo plans to give four SuperGrants ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 annually to area organizations that empower people in times of transition. Investing in the people of Middle Tennessee is way the Preds Foundation and SmileDirectClub can give back to the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">“When the Preds Foundation and SmileDirectClub first met with Operation Stand Down Tennessee, they told us that for years veteran support services were focused on reacting to the needs of veterans.&#8221; says Julia Wicoff, SmileDirectClub&#8217;s purpose platform director. &#8220;There were programs to help veterans after they had trouble finding a job, after they became isolated or after they started experiencing homelessness. We liked the idea that VFP was a proactive program. It gives veterans and veteran spouses a chance to transition into their civilian life on the right foot.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With its roots in serving Nashville&#8217;s homeless Veterans, today Operation Stand Down Tennessee&#8217;s purpose is to help all Veterans in Middle Tennessee manage their personal, career, and financial needs while creating a life they find fulfilling. With offices in Nashville and Clarksville, OSDT serves Veterans who may have significant needs like homelessness and addiction to those recently transitioning from military service who need career assistance or connection to a like-minded Veteran community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teens in foster care don&#8217;t have it easy.</p>
<p>They suffer from PTSD at twice the rate of veterans, they&#8217;re often separated from their siblings, and they get shuffled from one placement to another more often than younger children. That&#8217;s why SmileDirectClub teamed up with Together We Rise, a nonprofit that supports children in foster care, to present a pair of day-long Confidence Camps for 20 teens in a foster home in Southern California.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub also provided free treatments to 20 teens in foster care—because straight teeth can make everyone feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teens in the foster care system are often overlooked, and they don&#8217;t get the attention and support that they need,&#8221; says Gianna Dahlia, executive director of Together We Rise. &#8220;They struggle with self-esteem and confidence. That&#8217;s why we were so excited to work with SmileDirectClub to offer the camps and the treatments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;They&#8217;re giving them the tools they need to go through this traumatic time and feel good about themselves.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Celebrities, Catered Meals, and Pedicures</h2>
<p>The Confidence Camps were held on September 26 and October 3 at a foster care in Orange County. Twelve boys and nine girls aged 13 to 18 participated, with one camp for the girls and a second for the boys.</p>
<div id="attachment_2983" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2983" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2983" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-1.35.58-PM-207x300.png" alt="" width="284" height="412" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-1.35.58-PM-207x300.png 207w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-1.35.58-PM.png 598w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2983" class="wp-caption-text">Collin Sexton, point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, speaks to the boys via Zoom.</p></div>
<p>The boys had a video game competition, built skateboards, and binge-watched the &#8220;Mission Impossible&#8221; franchise for a movie night. The girls had a spa day with pedicures and facials, and they tie-dyed shirts. The highlight of the day for each group was a talk via Zoom with a celebrity influencer. Collin Sexton, point guard for the Cleveland Cavaliers, spoke to the boys, and Madison Bailey, star of the Netflix drama &#8220;Outer Banks,&#8221; spoke to the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys were super excited when they got to talk to Collin,&#8221; Dahlia says. &#8220;He was really engaging with them and answered all of their questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bailey, who was adopted, connected with the girls about the foster care experience. &#8220;Madison talked with them about how to build confidence, what it means being in foster care, what it means to be a woman of color in her industry, and bullying. All teens are facing bullying,&#8221; Dahlia says.</p>
<h2>Some Well-Deserved Joy</h2>
<p>The celebrity encounters were, of course, a big deal for the foster kids, as they would be for any teens. But it says a lot about these kids&#8217; experiences that they received so much joy from some of the more everyday parts of the event. The girls got robes to wear during their spa treatment, and they were a huge hit. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t take them off all day,&#8221; Dahlia says</p>
<p>The teens also got catered food at the camps, which was an extra special treat. &#8216;They usually get cafeteria food, so they were super excited about the food,&#8221; Dahlia says.</p>
<div id="attachment_2984" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2984" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2984" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-1.38.06-PM-300x177.png" alt="" width="388" height="229" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-1.38.06-PM-300x177.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-1.38.06-PM.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2984" class="wp-caption-text">Madison Bailey, from Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Outer Banks&#8221;, speaks with the girls via Zoom.</p></div>
<p>The Confidence Camps were originally supposed to be in-person, at a park, but the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the event online and onsite at the foster care facility. Like everyone else in America, the teens have been quarantined for months. They haven&#8217;t been able to go to school or to the summer camps that usually get them out into the world.&#8221;Foster care in general is tough, but now they&#8217;re quarantined in a group home,&#8221; Dahlia says. &#8220;This event meant a lot to them because it was a great opportunity to present a day of fun activities so they could alleviate some stress.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Knowing that teens in the foster care system often don&#8217;t get the support they need, let alone a day full of fun, SmileDirectClub wanted to help provide that.&#8221; says Julia Wicoff, SmileDirectClub&#8217;s purpose platform director. &#8220;Together We Rise was the perfect partner because they help kids in the foster care system every day. Together We Rise helped SmileDirectClub achieve our goal of giving the teens a fun day focused on confidence, but also the goal of giving the teens a lifetime of confidence through a smile they love.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Making Life Better for Foster Kids</h2>
<p>Together We Rise was founded in 2008 by Danny Mendoza, who, after learning his 8-year-old cousin was living in a car, dedicated his energy to making life better for vulnerable youth. The volunteer-based nonprofit is run by young adults with a passion for changing the lives of the more than 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system.</p>
<p>They work with donors to provide duffle bags, bikes, skateboards, trips, shopping sprees, and college scholarships to children in foster care. They help 250 kids nationwide in foster care every day, Dahlia says, which works out to around 60,000 kids a year.</p>
<p>Together We Rise partners with the foster system to make sure kids have positive experiences. They connect donors who want to help with kids who need help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Not everybody can foster or adopt, so we give people a way to give back,&#8221; Dahlia says. &#8220;Our funding comes from donors across the country who want to help make the lives of kids in foster care a little better.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>Friends Life Community helps teens and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities develop socially, grow personally, and enjoy community as they experience life together. The Nashville organization provides programming in employment, life skills, and arts programming, and social activities to 75 people ranging in age from 14 to over 50.</p>
<p>Friends Life Community has been able to help more adults with disabilities thanks to a SuperGrant from SmileDirectClub and the Nashville Predators Foundation. Friends Life Community used the funds for its Service Learning and Employment programs to teach participants (Friends) how to get and keep a job.</p>
<p>Because getting a job is key to independence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Our goal is for the Friends to gain meaningful employment so they can become more independent,&#8221; says Lauren Zook, director of philanthropy for Friends Life Community. &#8220;Too often, people with disabilities get out of high school and graduate to the couch. Friends Life Community is giving them the opportunity to grow and thrive in the world – to reach their fullest potential.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Three Steps to a Job</h3>
<p>Friends Life Community offers a three-step program to help the Friends, get ready for jobs: discovery and soft skills training, service learning (community volunteer work), and direct job coaching. It starts with classroom training where Friends learn how to write a resume, how to interview, and how to be at their best while on the job.</p>
<div id="attachment_2967" style="width: 583px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2967" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2967" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FLC-House-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="409" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FLC-House-300x214.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FLC-House-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FLC-House-768x548.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FLC-House-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FLC-House.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2967" class="wp-caption-text">Friend&#8217;s Life holds their classroom portion of their job training in their beautiful facility in Nashville</p></div>
<p>Once they&#8217;ve learned the basics, Friends go out into the community for hands-on learning opportunities. They work at nonprofits around Nashville in a position similar to an internship. The Friends have provided thousands of hours of volunteer work to nonprofits as participants gain job skills. They have assembled traffic lights, packed medical supply kits for Project C.U.R.E., and helped local churches set up for services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a safe place for the Friends to try, fail, and have support to learn and try again,&#8221; Zook says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When they&#8217;ve gotten enough experience, the big day arrives: They secure a paying job. Friends Life Community continues to help, providing a job coach who counsels the Friend while they work, providing the support they need to succeed.</p>
<p>Program participants aren&#8217;t the only ones who benefit from the job-training programs. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just teaching the Friends how to be contributing members of the community,&#8221; Zook says. &#8220;We&#8217;re teaching the community about the potential the Friends have. We&#8217;re teaching them about their abilities. The community learns about the benefits of inclusiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Friends Life Community has formalized that two-way learning process by training employees and managers who will work alongside a Friend through their Inclusive Employment training. &#8220;The SuperGrant has helped us do more of that,&#8221; Zook says.</p>
<h3>A Great Success Rate</h3>
<p>Michael, 32, has been a Friend for 11 years. He&#8217;s in the group&#8217;s job training program and has worked at The Well, Lipscomb University, and Edley&#8217;s Bar-B-Que, where he clears tables and greets the guests. &#8220;I like helping people,&#8221; he says.</p>
<div id="attachment_2968" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2968" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2968" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-Life_48-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="395" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-Life_48-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-Life_48-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-Life_48-768x512.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-Life_48-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-Life_48-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2968" class="wp-caption-text">Michael clearing tables at Edley&#8217;s BBQ, which is one of several part-time jobs he has.</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">His goal: &#8220;I want to move up to a full-time job and get my own apartment,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Friends Life Community is helping me with that.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friends Life Community has done an impressive job placing its clients in jobs. They&#8217;ve found work for Friends at Publix, Edley&#8217;s BBQ, Donut Den, and Nicky&#8217;s Coal Fired. Nationwide, the employment rate for people with intellectual disabilities is 19%. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 53% of the Friends were employed.</p>
<p>Since many of the Friends are employed in restaurants, an industry hit hard by the pandemic, all but one lost their job. But the job-training continues via Zoom classes, so that when the Friends can return to work, they will be ready.</p>
<h3>SuperGrants for a Stronger Community</h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub teamed up with the Nashville Predators Foundation in the 2019-2020 hockey season for the SuperGrant program. The duo gave five SuperGrants ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 annually to area organizations that empower people in times of transition. Investing in the people of Middle Tennessee is a way the Preds and SmileDirectClub can give back to the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;SuperGrants are given to organizations that offer the tools and skills needed to give people confidence as they go through a transition. Friends Life Community does this through their Service Learning and Employment program,&#8221; says Julia Wicoff, SmileDirectClub&#8217;s purpose platform director. &#8220;By being able to learn those necessary skills with the support of a job coach, they have the opportunity to build confidence as they transition into a permanent job.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="attachment_2969" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2969" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2969" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-shot-w-Mady-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="381" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-shot-w-Mady-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-shot-w-Mady-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-shot-w-Mady-768x512.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-shot-w-Mady-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Group-shot-w-Mady-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2969" class="wp-caption-text">The Friends have a lot of fun learning life skills.</p></div>
<p>The SuperGrant helped Friends Life Community give more Friends access to job training and a bright future. Together, Friends Life Community, SmileDirectClub, and the Nashville Predators Foundation are working to help teens and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities gain the confidence they need to live their best lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In February of 2018, then newly minted Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, sat before the House Energy and Commerce Committee and declared, “I am a big supporter of telehealth and how we can harness that, especially for underserved areas like our rural communities.” Fast forward to 2020, when the Secretary’s commitment to telehealth would be put to the test as COVID-19 swept the nation, and the world.</p>
<p>Enter SmileDirectClub. On Tuesday, the Nashville-based disruptor welcomed the Secretary to its Tennessee manufacturing facility, providing a tour of its 3D printing innovations and discussing their shared commitment to telehealth. When the pandemic hit, the proud U.S. manufacturer quickly pivoted the core use of their 3D printing manufacturing site from printing clear aligners for teeth straightening to creating over 60,000 face shields and other PPE for frontline healthcare workers &#8211; a move the Secretary called, “an example of the historic mobilization of the private sector.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Secretary’s visit was an important opportunity to shine a spotlight on the safety, efficacy, convenience of teledentistry and its applications for teeth straightening and remote care, all at significantly reduced costs.  We look forward to working with the Department of Health and Human Services to broaden access to care, especially for communities in remote or underserved locations.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">– Dr. Jeffrey Sulitzer, Chief Clinical Officer at SmileDirectClub</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a pioneer of teledentistry, SmileDirectClub is democratizing the oral care industry, increasing access to affordable teeth-straightening treatment, a service that has historically evaded underserved communities across the U.S. By removing the cost-prohibitive barrier of traditional orthodontic treatment and creating a variety of on-ramps for customers, including an at-home impression kit option, SmileDirectClub is not only increasing access to consumers, it’s revolutionizing the way they think about healthcare.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=606552123604675&amp;ref=watch_permalink">The Hill’s Virtual Town Hall, “Health Reimagined: The Future of Healthcare</a>,” Secretary Azar noted that telehealth is here to stay. “I think we&#8217;d have a revolution if anyone tried to go backwards on this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is now I think an embedded part of our health care system. It has changed the nature of delivery. It’s brought us better up to date in the system.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Friend&#8217;s House has been providing a home for at-risk teen boys with no other place to go for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>The organization is licensed by the Tennessee Department of Children&#8217;s Services and gives boys shelter, counseling, and a sense of stability while they work through traumas. Now, My Friend&#8217;s House is close to paying off the mortgage on a newly constructed house in Franklin, Tennessee, thanks to a SuperGrant from SmileDirectClub and the Nashville Predators Foundation. The beautiful new dwelling replaced a home My Friend&#8217;s House used for 28 years. After many years of use, the old house was deteriorating and there was an increasing need for an upgrade.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re a boy with no home, a sparkling house in the suburbs with a bedroom of your own—something many people take for granted—can be a game-changer.</p>

<h2>Empowering At-Risk Boys to Lead</h2>
<p>My Friend&#8217;s House shelters eight boys aged 13 to 18 who, for various reasons, cannot live with their families. &#8220;They&#8217;re in state custody, so the boys don&#8217;t have control over their lives,&#8221; says Laura Jumonville, Executive Development Director at My Friend&#8217;s House. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to get them to take control of their life again in a positive way and learn how to grow into responsible adults.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_2921" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2921" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2921" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyFriendsHouse4-300x213.png" alt="" width="483" height="343" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyFriendsHouse4-300x213.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyFriendsHouse4-1024x728.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyFriendsHouse4-768x546.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyFriendsHouse4-1536x1093.png 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/MyFriendsHouse4.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2921" class="wp-caption-text">Residents of My Friend&#8217;s House after painting together. Face are blurred to protect identities.</p></div>
<p>My Friend&#8217;s House does this by teaching life skills and confidence through therapy and hands-on life experiences. Adult staffers live with the boys and help them 24/7, making sure they get to school, therapy, and extra curricular activities like sports and volunteering . &#8220;We do lots of life skills, behavior modification therapies,&#8221; Jumonville says. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to empower them to lead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one of the most essential pieces of the boys&#8217; recovery is the house itself. &#8220;Giving those boys hot food, their own bed, and letting them know they&#8217;re safe and won&#8217;t be disrupted in the middle of the night with family chaos provides a base for them to grow and heal,&#8221; says Juanda Moore, Executive Program Director at My Friend&#8217;s House. &#8220;For many of them, it&#8217;s the first time they&#8217;ve had anything like a stable home life.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;He Could Envision A Better Life&#8217;</h2>
<p>My Friend&#8217;s House serves teens who have suffered from neglect or emotional and physical abuse. Some have struggled with substance abuse or the loss of one or both of their parents. They&#8217;re hurting. They don&#8217;t know how to deal with the misfortunes life has thrown at them, much less the usual adolescent pressures of peers, school, and teachers.</p>
<p>One 14-year-old came to My Friend&#8217;s House after years in the foster care system. His mother had died. His father had lost his parental rights. &#8220;The boy was hostile, and he was discouraged,&#8221; Moore says. His adult sister had offered to take custody of him, and that had given him hope. &#8220;He could envision a better life with his sister in another state. He made a decision that he wanted to make good choices. It was a big turning point for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy worked hard in the group therapy sessions held in the Empowerment Room, named for the SuperGrant, and started learning how to deal with life in more constructive ways. &#8220;If he got angry and had an outburst, he would recognize it, and say &#8216;Oh my gosh, I am sorry, can I do that over?'&#8221; Moore says.</p>
<p>Within a year, the boy finished the program successfully and moved out of My Friend&#8217;s House. &#8220;He became so self-aware,&#8221; Moore says. &#8220;He got so much more confident and in control of his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy is 15 now. He lives with his sister, has a job, and is about to join a football team. &#8220;His entire life has changed,&#8221; says Moore.</p>
<h2>A New House Keeps the Program Alive<b></b></h2>
<p>SmileDirectClub teamed up with the Nashville Predators Foundation during the 2019-2020 hockey season for the SuperGrant program. The partners plan to give four or five SuperGrants ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 annually to area organizations that empower people in times of transition. Investing in the people of Middle Tennessee is one way the Preds Foundation and SmileDirectClub can give back to the community.</p>
<p>The SuperGrant to My Friend&#8217;s House allowed the group to offer a 1:1 matching gift so donors could double their contribution to help pay off the house. &#8220;We desperately needed the funds,&#8221; says Moore. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t have a house, we don&#8217;t have a program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moore has seen that house change lives. &#8220;Boys come to the house withdrawn,&#8221; she says. “They wear their hoodies with the hood drawn tightly around their face. By day three, that hoodie is off, and they&#8217;re smiling. In just a couple of days, they feel so much happier and so much more secure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We probably don’t have to tell you how important your aligner case is &#8211; it’s the safest place for your aligners during treatment and then your retainer’s forever-home. Life can be stressful and keeping track of your aligners should be easy. That’s why we partnered with <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/?ref=tiledotcom&amp;utm_source=tiledotcom">Tile<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> to create a trackable case to help you keep tabs on where your aligners are at all times. <img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2913 alignleft" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-case-3-300x300.png" alt="" width="375" height="375" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-case-3-300x300.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-case-3-150x150.png 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-case-3.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p>Our patented <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/tile-case">trackable aligner case</a> is the first in the industry, using app-initiated technology to solve for misplaced aligners or retainers, especially after removing them to eat (remember: a napkin is NOT a case). Our case features built-in Bluetooth tracking technology powered by Tile and includes a slide-out mirror just like our standard aligner case.</p>
<blockquote><p>“A common reason that consumers’ teeth-straightening process is interrupted is simply because they have lost their aligners or retainers,” said Josh Chapman, Chief Global Brand Officer for SmileDirectClub. “Our new case will help all Club members avoid that interruption as well as the potential cost of having to pay for any replacements.”</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>How it works</strong></h2>
<p>In order to utilize this feature, you’ll need to download the Tile app (from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tile-find-lost-keys-phone/id664939913">Apple App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetileapp.tile&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a>) and create an account. From there, the app will walk you through step-by-step on how to get started.<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2912 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-Case-2-300x300.png" alt="" width="449" height="449" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-Case-2-300x300.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-Case-2-150x150.png 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tile-Case-2.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<p>Once activated, if the case is within a 100-foot distance of your mobile device, the case will make a sound to help you locate it. You can even set up a friend or parent to also receive alerts from the device.</p>
<p>Retainers aren’t the only thing consumers lose. SmileDirectClub’s Tile case can also be used <em>in reverse</em> to locate the owner’s mobile device using Tile. Click twice on the Tile logo on the back of the aligner case to initiate a tone to play on your mobile device, even if your phone is on silent. So, if you’re one of those people that loses things often, we’ve got you covered either way!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ShowerUp brings dignity and comfort to the homeless and working poor in Nashville through hot showers.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s founding in 2016, the organization has been providing showers and toiletry items at its mobile shower trailers to people who don&#8217;t have any other place to wash up. Over the past four years, ShowerUp have provided this service to over 7,000 members of the community.</p>
<p>Now ShowerUp has a fourth mobile shower unit serving Music City thanks to a SuperGrant from SmileDirectClub and the Nashville Predators Foundation. ShowerUp used the funds to buy a new tow vehicle to pull its three-shower unit to different locations all over town.</p>
<div id="attachment_2898" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2898" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2898" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/61787527_2207543029360156_8187303170599288832_o-284x300.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="413" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/61787527_2207543029360156_8187303170599288832_o-284x300.jpg 284w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/61787527_2207543029360156_8187303170599288832_o-968x1024.jpg 968w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/61787527_2207543029360156_8187303170599288832_o-768x812.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/61787527_2207543029360156_8187303170599288832_o.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2898" class="wp-caption-text">The inside of one of ShowerUp&#8217;s showers with toiletry items and a fresh towel.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;Nashville has a large number of working poor and working homeless. Some of them do pretty heavy-duty, manual labor,&#8221; says ShowerUp co-founder Paul Schmitz. &#8220;Before we launched ShowerUp, they would go to the river to bathe, they would wait till it rained, or they would wash up at a sink in a public restroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the organization&#8217;s SuperGrant, even more people will have access to the important, empowering experience of showering up.</p>
<h2>How Showers Empower</h2>
<p>When you live on the street, a hot, steamy shower in a private stall feels like heaven. But before ShowerUp showed up, a shower was out of reach for most people living on the street. That&#8217;s because there were only 12 shower heads in metro Nashville available, and they typically had limited hours.</p>
<p>Now ShowerUp trailers allow 100 to 200 people a week get a hot shower in a clean, private stall with a locking door, along with towels, washcloths, soap, and shampoo. &#8220;A locked door is a luxury when you live on the street,&#8221; Schmitz says.</p>
<p>But ShowerUp isn&#8217;t just about helping people wash up. It&#8217;s about helping them find the confidence to move forward in their lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The shower is part of a mission to be involved in a person&#8217;s life,&#8221; Schmitz says. &#8220;We&#8217;re a first line of interaction for those who are living in a tent or on the street. We build trust. We restore dignity to their lives, along with confidence and hope. We let them know that they are loved and they matter.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>ShowerUp serves people of all ages, races, and genders who range from veterans on the street to families living in their cars. They assist many people who may suffer from joblessness, disability, or addiction.</p>
<h2>Showers Transform Lives</h2>
<p>ShowerUp delivers more than the chance to get clean for a day. Kevin, for example, became homeless for the first time in his life at the age of 50. The business where he&#8217;d worked for years shut down after his boss got COVID-19. Kevin lost his job.</p>
<div id="attachment_2897" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2897" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2897" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unknown-225x300.jpeg" alt="Shower Up" width="311" height="415" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unknown-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unknown.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2897" class="wp-caption-text">A man waiting for his turn at the ShowerUp trailer.</p></div>
<p>Unable to pay his rent, Kevin had been on the street for 10 days when he came to a ShowerUp mobile unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had been washing up with bottles of water,&#8221; Schmitz says. &#8220;He was hot, dirty, and sapped when he came to us. When he got out of the shower, he was transformed. You saw the difference immediately. You could tell he felt so much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling better can sometimes lead to doing better, too. A homeless man in his mid-30s had been on the street for eight months when he told a volunteer after his shower, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to live like this anymore. I want help for my addiction.&#8221; Schmitz made some calls, and by the end of the afternoon the man was on his way to a rehab facility. A ShowerUp volunteer drove him, stopping by the man&#8217;s family home in Nashville en route so he could tell his mother that he was on the way to changing his life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He worked a job, he just needed to get free of his addiction,&#8221; Schmitz says. &#8220;He got help because people showed up who cared.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tornados And COVID Have Increased Need</h2>
<p>SmileDirectClub teamed up with the Nashville Predators Foundation during the 2019-2020 hockey season for the SuperGrant program. The partners plan to give four or five SuperGrants ranging from $25,000 to $100,000 annually to area organizations that empower people in times of transition. Investing in the people of Middle Tennessee is one way the Nashville Predators Foundation and SmileDirectClub can give back to the community.</p>

<p>The grant to ShowerUp couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time. Schmitz says the organization has seen a 62% increase in the number of people using its showers year-over-year due to the Nashville tornados in March 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Schmitz has seen those showers change lives. &#8220;We had a guy come back to see us; his name was George. He said, &#8216;You helped me a year ago when I was on the street,'&#8221; Schmitz says.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Because he was able to get a shower on a regular basis, he was able to go to job interviews. He got a job. He got an apartment. He got a car. And he got a girlfriend. He wanted to come back to say &#8216;thank you.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
