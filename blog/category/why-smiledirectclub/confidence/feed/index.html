										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things give one an ego boost like having Hollywood-worthy teeth.</p>
<p>Just ask Addie Sibley, 16. The high school sophomore is flashing a perfect smile after spending just four months in SmileDirectClub aligners. Talk about speed straightening. Addie&#8217;s crowded teeth have transformed into a gorgeous grin in just one semester of high school. She says that most of her friends have braces or another brand of clear aligners, and it took more than a year for their teeth to straighten. &#8220;So they&#8217;re shocked at how fast my teeth improved,&#8221; Addie says.</p>
<p>Her new smile has changed her life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before, when I would be laughing, I would cover my teeth with my hand,&#8221; Addie says. “I would make sure people could only see me from certain angles, and I would always smile with my mouth closed.&#8221; Her days of hiding her teeth are over. “Now I smile with my mouth open, to show my teeth,&#8221; she says.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Family of Brighter (and Affordable) Smiles</h2>
<p>Her brother, Joey, 14, is wearing SmileDirectClub aligners too. He also had crowded teeth that were making him self-conscious. The eighth-grader started in treatment at the same time as Addie and completed treatment in May 2020.</p>
<p>The kids each chose different treatment plans. Addie got SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Clear Aligners, which she wore day and night for a treatment that took less than six months. Joey has Nighttime Clear Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. That means he wears them only at night, so his treatment takes longer (up to 10 months). The reason they took different paths? Addie was interested in finishing her treatment as quickly as possible, but Joey didn&#8217;t want to wear the aligners while playing sports. Both kids found a plan that fit their own priorities and schedule.</p>
<p>Before it all started, the Sibley teens <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/parents/">knew they wanted to do something about their smiles</a>, says their dad, Joe Sibley, an attorney in Austin, Texas. But when he took them to an orthodontist to look into getting braces, the price gave him sticker shock. The price quoted was $7,000 to $8,000 for a two-year treatment plan for both kids, with monthly office visits.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t fit with the family&#8217;s schedule or budget. &#8220;We were at a place of, &#8216;Do we really want to do it?'&#8221; Joe says. Because the only thing more expensive than braces for a teenager is braces for two teenagers.</p>
<p>But then Joe saw a commercial for SmileDirectClub and &#8220;a light went on,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I thought, it&#8217;s probably like everything else, that there&#8217;s an online solution that&#8217;s better than anything you find in a store.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Getting Two Teens Into Aligners</h2>
<p>Joe took Addie and Joey in for the initial 3D scan at a SmileShop in Austin, Texas. “We liked the relaxed feel of the place, and they answered all our questions,&#8221; Joe says. Even better was the price of the SmileDirectClub treatment plan, which was 60% less than traditional braces. &#8220;You could pay for a cruise to Alaska with the money we saved,&#8221; Joe says.</p>
<p>Addie and Joey saw improvements in their teeth as soon as they were done with their first set of aligners. &#8220;My smile looked better after a week,&#8221; Addie says. “You could really see it was moving my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took photos of her teeth three times a month, holding up her phone and snapping selfies to track her progress and stay motivated.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The photos inspired me to keep going,&#8221; she says. “Sometimes I didn&#8217;t want to put the aligners in. But I would look at the photos, see how much better my teeth looked, and keep going.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Addie and Joey say the aligners <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">were uncomfortable at first</a>, but they got used to them. <mark class="" data-mark-id="51932a7b-ccf3-40df-b72d-fbc31d26da06"></mark>Four months in, Joey can already see a difference — and so can his friends, because they&#8217;re telling him how good his teeth are looking. &#8220;It&#8217;s made me feel a lot more confident,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>A Household of Confident Kids</h2>
<p>Joe says he hasn&#8217;t had to be a helicopter dad to make sure the kids wear the aligners because the support they&#8217;ve gotten from SmileDirectClub staff has helped Addie and Joey manage their own treatment. &#8220;It&#8217;s been very user-friendly. We get the reminder emails that go out, telling them when to change the aligners,&#8221; he says. &#8220;To be honest, sometimes I forget (Addie and Joey) have (aligners.) I really don&#8217;t hear anything about them from either of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there have been sacrifices. No gum. No late-night snacks. But straight teeth are worth it. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be ready to try new things now that I feel better about my teeth,&#8221; Addie says. &#8220;My teeth were an insecurity of mine. They were holding me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joey says having straighter teeth is already making him more outgoing. &#8220;I&#8217;m more likely to talk to somebody if I&#8217;m not worried they&#8217;re judging my teeth. I feel a lot more secure about how I look.&#8221; Unlike his peers in braces, Joey doesn&#8217;t want wires glinting in his mouth whenever he speaks. Clear aligners let those straight teeth show sooner.</p>
<p>Joe says he&#8217;s delighted with the difference he sees in his kids&#8217; smiles and lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They have more confidence, and they are more comfortable speaking and smiling,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It makes me feel good as a parent because you want your kids to have all they need to be successful and happy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Read why Cassidy says &#8216;it&#8217;s like confidence in a box.&#8217;</h2>
<p>Cassidy was never wild about her smile.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old had an overbite, and her front tooth was crooked. &#8220;I had a snaggletooth,&#8221; she says. &#8220;No one ever said anything about it, but I was very insecure. I thought about (my teeth) constantly. I was hesitant to even smile.&#8221; Look at photos of her growing up, and Cassidy&#8217;s smiling with a closed mouth, to hide her teeth.</p>
<p>About two years ago she decided to change her smile — and her life: She got SmileDirectClub aligners.</p>
<p>Just six months later, she had a mouth full of straight, white teeth. Now she flashes a smile that flaunts her movie-star-worthy teeth. &#8220;I smile a lot more,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Now I have no problem talking to strangers or my friends.&#8221;</p>
<h3>An affordable path to new confidence</h3>
<p>Cassidy&#8217;s teeth had bothered her since she was a little kid. &#8220;I got made fun of for my teeth in elementary school,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I had buck teeth even then, and my teeth didn&#8217;t fit my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the teasing affected her personality, making her shy and withdrawn. &#8220;I got so cautious,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t eager to speak up or be noticed because people would judge my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed like a permanent condition. Her family never looked into getting her braces because they couldn&#8217;t afford them. &#8220;My family wasn&#8217;t in the top of the money scale. We had other things to pay for,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018, when a 22-year-old Cassidy saw a Facebook ad for SmileDirectClub at 2 a.m. &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Hmm, that looks interesting,'&#8221; she says. While braces cost an average of US$5,000 to US$6,000, SmileDirectClub could straighten her teeth for up to 60% less than traditional braces. Cassidy was so impressed that she opened a savings account that week so she could start socking away money for her dream smile.</p>
<h3>Empowering her own smile</h3>
<p>Cassidy, a shift manager at a sandwich shop in Cleveland, spent the next nine months saving money for SmileDirectClub clear aligners. Her dad contributed money toward the cause too. &#8220;He had always known my teeth were a big insecurity for me, and he wanted to help,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Cassidy had her initial 3D image done in a SmileDirectClub office in Cleveland. And she got her aligners in December 2018, right after her daughter, Elaina, was born. Talk about piling on the life changes. She was a new mom on her way to a new smile. &#8220;I figured it was a good time for me to try to do something for myself,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>To document the changes to her teeth — and share her smile journey with the world — Cassidy started an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cass_sdcjourney/">Instagram account</a> and posted photos of her teeth weekly. &#8220;There were times when I was feeling discouraged, like my teeth weren&#8217;t moving,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So I would go back and look at photos from a few months earlier, and it helped. I could see such a big difference.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The world is smiling with her</h3>
<p>When she returned to her job from maternity leave, after just three months in the aligners, her coworkers were blown away by her improved smile. &#8220;They all said, &#8216;Wow! You look great!'&#8221; Cassidy says. &#8220;It made me feel so good. I was still wearing aligners, but I was already getting compliments.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she completed her treatment in June 2019, she couldn&#8217;t believe the gorgeous grin beaming back at her in the mirror. &#8220;My teeth had shown a crazy-good amount of change,&#8221; she says. &#8220;My smile was great!&#8221;</p>
<h3>A new smile and more to smile about</h3>
<p>A great smile has been life-changing. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to laugh at a joke, and I don&#8217;t think about how I have to hold my mouth so my teeth look OK,&#8221; Cassidy says. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a big weight off my shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cassidy says she&#8217;s more outgoing now, and the world seems bigger and friendlier. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think twice about talking to strangers,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I smile a lot more at people, and I feel like people are smiling more at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when she&#8217;s talking to customers throughout her 11-hour shifts at work, that means she&#8217;s spending a lot of her life as a more confident Cassidy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like confidence in a box,&#8221; she says.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you've been thinking about straightening your smile, consider these added health benefits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Straight teeth don&#8217;t just look good, there are awesome health benefits too.</h2>
<p>The benefits of straighter teeth go far beyond loving your smile. Dental research shows that straighter teeth are actually healthier teeth.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about straightening your smile, consider these added health benefits of straight teeth.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smile_assessment" class="btn btn--purple">
			Are you a candidate for invisible aligners?		</a>
	</p>
	
<h3>What are the health benefits of straight teeth?</h3>
<h3>1. Easy cleaning</h3>
<h3>2. Healthier teeth</h3>
<h3>3. Healthier gums</h3>
<h3>4. Less wear and tear</h3>
<h3>5. Improved speech</h3>
<h3>6. Improved overall health</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Easy cleaning</h3>
<p>Crowded teeth may make flossing frustrating due to the lack of space between your teeth, which can make it hard to get the floss into all the nooks and crannies. Many people who&#8217;ve straightened their teeth with invisible aligners find it much easier to floss within just the few first weeks of wearing their aligners. And if it&#8217;s easier to floss, you&#8217;re more likely to keep up with it.</p>
<h3>2. Healthier teeth</h3>
<p>Clean teeth are healthier teeth. Trapped food in your teeth can lead to plaque, which increases the risk of cavities and tooth decay – both of which can mean costly dental work. Not only will aligners straighten your smile to help avoid that, but you&#8217;ll also be be brushing and flossing after every meal or snack.</p>
<h3>3. Healthier gums</h3>
<p>In many cases, red and swollen gums are a direct result of teeth that are too widely spaced or too crowded, which can be minimized by straightening your smile. <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-culprits-linked-inflammation-bone-loss-gum-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research reported by the NIH</a> has shown a link between periodontal disease and the loss of bone and teeth. And a lot of other <a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/gum-disease/more-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bad stuff</a>. Having straighter teeth helps your gums fit around your teeth better, reducing your risk of developing gum disease.</p>
<h3>4. Less wear and tear</h3>
<p>Your teeth do a lot of work. Every time you bite down, they&#8217;re sustaining pressure. That extra pressure can cause your teeth to wear down sooner than they should – plus other scary stuff like possible gum recession, poor support at the roots, and loose teeth. It can also cause shoulder pain, neck pain, headaches, or muscle pain in the temples where the jaws meet near the ears.  Straightening your smile now can prevent you a lot of headaches down the road.</p>
<h3>5. Improved speech</h3>
<p>As a key part of your mouth, your teeth play an important role in your speech. Gapped, protruding, or crowded teeth can affect your speaking patterns. Straightening your smile can help. You might notice a bit of a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/7-things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners-that-are-totally-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lisp</a> when you first start wearing your aligners, but in an average of just 6 months you could have the smile of your dreams <em>and</em> improved speech.</p>
<h3>6. Improved overall health</h3>
<p>Poor dental health <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/dental/art-20047475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been linked to</a> heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and more. Keep up with brushing, flossing, and regular dentist visits to help keep the rest of your body healthy, too. Don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/retainer-questions-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order a new set of retainers</a> every 6 months too to protect your new smile and prevent bad oral bacteria.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub straightens most smiles in an average of 4-6 months and is up to 60% less than traditional braces. Now is the time to invest in yourself and your health.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting a straighter smile shouldn't get in the way of serving your country. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>&#8220;My husband </b><b>is a representation of so many service members and veterans who sacrifice their lives and deserve a smile that they can be proud of</b><b>.&#8221;</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p>Getting a straighter smile shouldn&#8217;t get in the way of serving your country.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>After seeing SmileDirectClub on social media, Sgt. Elijah L. Redmond began asking around about it at work and was surprised to learn that several of his co-workers had used SmileDirectClub to straighten their smiles. Elijah and his wife, Sierra, did some research of their own and found that SmileDirectClub invisible aligners were the best option for their military family.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;With SmileDirectClub, he can continue his job in the military, and because the [aligners] are removable, we can still participate in our favorite activities,&#8221; Sierra says. &#8220;We want to be able to correct his smile while not disturbing our busy lifestyle. It&#8217;s also super affordable!&#8221;<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>SmileDirectClub doesn&#8217;t require any in-person office visits and is up to 60% less than traditional braces. Our aligners straighten teeth under the supervision of a network of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">250 affiliated, state licensed dentists and orthodontists</a>. Plus, our aligners are a great option for servicemen and servicewomen because they&#8217;re approved for deployment. (We also offer an active military discount, among several other benefits.)<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Just in time for the 4th of July, Elijah and Sierra are sharing why SmileDirectClub was the best choice for their family – and how they&#8217;ll be celebrating our country&#8217;s independence this year together as a family.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<h3><b>Elijah, w</b><b>hat are your main concerns about your smile? </b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Elijah:</b> I feel like I must pick a side to smile on. One side of my teeth are not perfect but easier to look at. The other side is extremely crooked, and I have been self-conscious about my appearance in pictures. I always try to find my “good side.&#8221; I just want the ability to smile on  both sides and  feel confident. This has been a lifelong struggle of mine, and it goes beyond the military. I wish to feel like my best self, especially when I get out and seek civilian employment. My new smile will enhance my professional appearance. I feel like teeth are the first thing people notice about you in a face-to-face setting. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>What made </b><b>SmileDirectClub</b><b> </b><b>particularly appealing to you as a military family?</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Sierra:</b> In the military, having braces causes a soldier to become non-deployable. It is no longer recommended that a soldier deploy and participate in various tasks and drills. They need to be able to do their job, but it doesn’t mean that their appearance should suffer. He is a representation of so many service members and veterans who sacrifice their lives and deserve a smile that they can be proud of. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>What was the experience of getting a scan in our </b><b>SmileShop</b><b> like for you</b><b>? </b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Elijah:</b> Our experience with SmileDirectClub has been amazing. The <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-scan/">3D image</a> process was simple and painless. The staff was very nice and got the job done quickly. It was amazing to see the new technology and how it can create your new smile in just a few days.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Sierra, what does it mean to you to be able to give the gift of</b><b> </b><b>SmileDirectClub</b><b> to </b><b>your</b><b> husband?</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Sierra:</b> I am looking forward to seeing his new smile, and I know that he is super excited as well. Traditional braces were always too expensive and not conducive to our military lifestyle, so we didn’t think that we would be able to achieve the look that he always wanted. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>How will you be celebrating </b><b>the </b>4th<b> </b><b>of</b><b> July this year? Any favorite traditions?</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Sierra:</b> Luckily, Elijah is off work this year for the 4th, and we can celebrate together. As a military family, we have the tradition of going on the local military base for the 4th of July celebration and fireworks. There is truly a sense of pride and patriotism during holidays like the 4th, especially as a military family. This country is what it is today because of brave men and women who serve in the military. We are proud to be American and a military family!<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ready to achieve alignment? Here are 9 things to know before you start SmileDirectClub.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re ready to straighten that smile, but you still have questions. Like, how does SmileDirectClub work, anyway? We understand. At SmileDirectClub, we want you to feel as confident with our aligners as you will be with your new smile.</p>
<p>First, SmileDirectClub aligners are a series of doctor-directed, custom-fitting plastic trays that help straighten teeth that need mild to moderate adjustment, for up to 60% less than traditional braces. And our average treatment time is 4-6 months.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what else you should know about using our clear aligners.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1749 size-full" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/treatment-2.gif" alt="smile direct club plan" width="800" height="532" /></p>
<h3>1. SmileDirectClub is a great fit for many: Our aligners work best for mild to moderate concerns.</h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligners are designed for minor to moderate crowding, spacing, and general alignment concerns. The aligners can fit over wisdom teeth, crowns and fillings. But if you just had a crown put in, you may want to wait a few months before popping in aligners.</p>
<p>Also, aligners won&#8217;t shift implanted teeth (which are screwed to the bone and can&#8217;t move). Our aligners are for anyone 12 and up — you must have all your adult teeth. We also recommend a good cleaning from your local dentist, and filling any cavities, before using aligners.</p>
<h3>2. You&#8217;ll start with a 3D image.</h3>
<p>To create your custom treatment plan, we need to see your current smile. You can schedule a free, 30-minute appointment at one of our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/">SmileShops</a>, or you can make your own impressions with an <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout">Impression Kit</a>. This image is used to create your treatment plan, which is reviewed and approved by the state licensed dentist or orthodontist overseeing your case.</p>
<h3>3. You&#8217;ll get a sneak peek of your new smile.</h3>
<p>Within about 72 hours, you&#8217;ll receive a preview of what your new smile will look like. You can log into your SmileDirectClub account or hop onto our app for a 3D view. You can get a complete view of how your teeth will move over the course of your treatment.</p>
<h3>4. You&#8217;ll be assigned a state licensed dentist or orthodontist.</h3>
<p>We work with a network of over <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/">250 dentists and orthodontists</a>, and each Club member is assigned one who is licensed where you live. This doctor will oversee your new smile and will schedule regular virtual check-ins with you. During treatment, you can talk to our Dental team or your doctor directly if you have any concerns.</p>
<h3>5. Wearing aligners takes some adjustment &#8212; and care.</h3>
<p>How long does SmileDirectClub take? We get that one a lot. You&#8217;ll wear aligners 22 hours a day (or 10 consecutive hours if you&#8217;re using Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). The average treatment time for aligners is 4-6 months, or 8-10 for Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. You may feel some soreness when you first use new aligners, just as you might <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/blog/things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners-that-are-totally-normal">feel sore</a> after using new muscles at the gym — that&#8217;s expected.</p>
<p>You can eat whatever you want, just remove the aligners before doing so or before drinking anything other than water. Brush your teeth before you pop them back in. You&#8217;ll need to <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners">clean your aligners</a>, but we make that pretty easy.</p>
<h3>6. You need to finish the whole treatment plan.</h3>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve hit month three, and your teeth don&#8217;t seem to have shifted much. Everyone&#8217;s smile journey is different and some Club members may see movement sooner than others. If you&#8217;re ever worried, you can always give us a call and we can make sure you&#8217;re on track.</p>
<h3>7. Retainers keep everything in place long-term.</h3>
<p>After aligners have finished, you&#8217;ll wear a retainer to keep everything in place. Otherwise, teeth naturally want to shift back to their original spot. After two weeks of round-the-clock wear, you&#8217;ll keep the retainer in only at night. Like the aligners, retainers are clear and cleanable. We recommend replacing them every six months or so.</p>
<h3>8. You still need regular dental checkups.</h3>
<p>Despite all our fancy technology and skilled dental experts on-call 24/7, we don&#8217;t have the ability to clean teeth or fill a cavity from afar. You&#8217;ll want to keep your twice-yearly checkup and cleaning schedule as you would even without SmileDirectClub aligners.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more success with tooth movement when there&#8217;s better periodontal health,&#8221; Dr. Sulitzer says.</p>
<p>Your dentist can help ensure nothing seems out of place and keep your new smile healthy and glowing.</p>
<h3>9. SmileDirectClub comes with 24/7 support from our Customer Care team.</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re with you for your entire treatment plan. Our Customer Care team is ready to help via chat, email, phone and social media 24/7. They can take your questions, listen to your concerns and hear out your SmileDirectClub reviews. Whatever is on your mind, we&#8217;re here for you.</p>
<p>Take it from Rachel J.:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customer care is outstanding. Phone calls answered very quickly and very helpful staff. Emails also answered very quickly. I received my invisible aligners and started my journey to straighter and whiter teeth (I also got complimentary whitening gel, which I could use with my aligners! Super easy). Customer care emailed me every time my aligners needed to be changed, so I never forgot. The time flew by and now my teeth look so much better than they did before. Bonus … Nobody knew I was wearing them!</p>
<p>“I’ve had a lot of compliments about how great my smile is. I would highly recommend SmileDirectClub to anyone wanting to improve their smile.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Did you know that many of our customers experience benefits other than teeth-straightening from using SmileDirectClub invisible aligners?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aligners’ primary purpose is to straighten teeth using custom-fitting plastic that makes the process discreet, convenient, and easy. The known benefits of clear aligners are clear (no pun intended), but did you know that many customers experience other, unexpected benefits from aligner treatment, too?</p>
<h2>Known Benefits of SmileDirectClub aligners</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Clear and discreet</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Easy to remove for eating, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning</a>, and <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/?referrer=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flossing</a></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Custom-made for each Club member</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Up to 60% less than traditional braces</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Treatment times average of 4-6 months</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Added Benefits of aligners</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Snacking less often</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Weight loss</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Improved dental hygiene</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Quitting smoking</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>No more nail-biting</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Snacking less often</h3>
<p>Many people say they snack less often when they’re straightening their teeth with clear aligners. The simple action of removing the aligners to eat, and brushing before putting them back in after the snack, is enough to make customers think twice before dipping their hands into the candy bowl.</p>
<h3>Weight loss</h3>
<p>In a recent survey, 15% of SmileDirectClub customers who completed their plans said they weigh less than when they started. Turns out, stopping all that afternoon grazing really cuts the calories, too! On average, those customers say they lost a whopping 7 pounds throughout the course of wearing clear aligners.</p>
<h3>Improved dental hygiene</h3>
<p>More than half of SmileDirectClub customers surveyed report <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/">improved dental hygiene</a> while wearing aligners compared to before they started. It’s always recommended that customers brush and floss before putting aligners in, even if it’s after a small snack, and visit their local dentists regularly. All that extra attention really seems to help. Plus, the straighter a customer’s smile gets, the more motivated they are to maintain it.</p>
<h3>Quitting smoking</h3>
<p>A number of Club members quit smoking while wearing aligners. We always recommend that customers remove their aligners before smoking and brush their teeth before putting aligners back in. Similar to snacking, the frequency of smoke breaks, and the subsequent brushing, is enough to encourage people to kick the habit – something many of them already wanted to do in the first place!</p>
<h3>No more nail-biting</h3>
<p>Because aligners wrap around the top and bottom teeth, it makes it very difficult to bite something. For this reason, many customers find themselves gradually dropping their nail-biting habit. Wearing aligners makes what used to be a mindless habit more prominent and helps Club members quit.</p>
<p>What other benefits have you experienced while wearing clear aligners? Or, if you’re getting ready to start your smile journey, which of these benefits makes you most excited?
