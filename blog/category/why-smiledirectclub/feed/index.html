										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lynne Gawley Hofstetter was never wild about her smile.</p>
<p>She felt that one of her front teeth stuck out too far, and her bottom teeth were crooked. She hid them by not smiling. &#8220;I never smiled a big, toothy grin,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t showing my true personality. People thought I was unfriendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had wanted straight teeth ever since she was a kid, but her parents couldn&#8217;t afford braces.</p>
<p>When Lynne became a parent, she bought <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/can-you-straighten-your-teeth-without-braces/">braces</a> for her two children, and she mulled getting braces for herself. After all, she still dreamed of straight teeth.</p>
<p>She consulted with orthodontists—twice—but after they told her how long it would take to straighten her teeth and how much it would <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a>, she decided braces were not for her. &#8220;Orthodontists talked me out of getting them,&#8221; says Lynne, who lives in Ontario, Canada. &#8220;I just decided to live with my teeth as they were.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;I decided to turn it all around&#8217;</h2>
<p>Nine years ago, Lynne&#8217;s world was upended when her husband was killed in an on-the-job accident. She was left a widow at 49. The years that followed his death were difficult for Lynne. &#8220;I got into a bad relationship after my husband died,&#8221; Lynne says. By the time it ended, she was feeling terrible about herself.</p>
<p>She needed a pick-me-up—something to help move her life in a positive direction. That&#8217;s when she saw an ad for SmileDirectClub on Facebook. Lynne looked into the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/">prices</a> and couldn&#8217;t believe how affordable the aligners were. &#8220;SmileDirectClub is an amazing option for those without health or dental benefits,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3125" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C.jpeg" alt="Lynne shows off her new smile with a selfie" width="547" height="546" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C.jpeg 1125w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/E452C397-806B-44D2-AC2E-B31B205E221C-768x767.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></p>
<p>Lynne realized she could afford the straight teeth she had always wanted, and that she could get a better smile faster than those orthodontists had told her was possible. It was time to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was feeling really down, so I just decided to turn it all around,&#8221; Lynne says. She ordered an impression kit and improved her smile without leaving home.</p>
<p>She went with the standard clear aligners, and she wore them faithfully. Lynne saw improvements in her smile within six weeks. Six months later, she had the perfect grin she had always wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I have a straighter smile now—and, well, I can&#8217;t stop smiling,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I feel so vibrant and so excited. People tell me I glow!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The SmileDirectClub treatment fit her lifestyle</h2>
<p>Lynne couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it was to change her grin with SmileDirectClub.</p>
<p>Instead of going into a SmileShop for a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/">3D scan</a>, she went with the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impression kit</a> she could do at home. She made and returned the smile impressions. A bit later, her 3D images arrived, along with a digital rendering of what her new smile would look like after treatment.</p>
<p>She ordered her aligners. They arrived in the mail a few weeks later.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3117" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne4.png" alt="Lynee after starting her fitness journey and gaining confidence through her smile" width="403" height="623" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne4.png 654w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne4-194x300.png 194w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I was a bit skeptical in the beginning,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The aligners are so thin and almost flimsy feeling.&#8221; But she followed the instructions, and soon she realized those aligners were moving her teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was some <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">mild discomfort</a> as my teeth began to shift,&#8221; she says. &#8220;But I expected it. The SmileDirectClub instructions prepared me for that.&#8221; Lynne says she had a bit of a lisp when she was wearing her aligners, but that it wasn&#8217;t very pronounced. No one noticed the aligners when she was wearing them, she says.</p>
<p>The at-home treatments fit her lifestyle. She loved not having to schlep to an orthodontist&#8217;s office every month for adjustments. She had taken both of the children to those monthly appointments for years, so she knew firsthand how inconvenient it was. With SmileDirectClub, she changed her aligners herself and could talk to a specialist via phone, email, chat, or social, whenever she had a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not miss that part at all,&#8221; Lynne says of the in-person visits.&#8221;SmileDirectClub made this so easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Changing her smile changed her whole life, Lynne explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about the smile—it&#8217;s about taking care of yourself,&#8221; she says. A better smile made her get more serious about physical fitness, and she became a regular at a gym. Slimmer, stronger, and more confident, Lynne retired from her job as a chiropractor&#8217;s assistant.</p>
<p>She now works as a marketer for her gym, but just part-time, so she has more time to enjoy her life—especially spending time with her granddaughter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3118" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6.png" alt="Lynne takes a selfie with her current partner." width="482" height="556" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6.png 816w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6-260x300.png 260w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Lynne6-768x887.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /></p>
<p>But big life changes didn&#8217;t just happen around work. Lynne also found a new love. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a brand new relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I&#8217;m giddy in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>At 58, she&#8217;s never been happier. Her positivity rubs off on those around her. Straightening her teeth was a key part of her turnaround, she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I want people to know that you&#8217;re never too old to stop improving yourself,&#8221; she says. &#8220;By taking care of yourself, that has a domino effect on others. Happiness really is contagious.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a pediatrician in a hospital pediatric intensive care unit, Dr. Corey Chartan cares for some of Houston&#8217;s most medically fragile children. Outside of his medical practice, he keeps up with two small kids at home, too. That schedule doesn&#8217;t leave him a lot of time for self-care.</p>
<p>When Corey realized the impact of his childhood braces had slipped, and his smile wasn&#8217;t where he needed it, he wanted a fix. Corey lives with Brian, his partner of 10 years, and has two children, Brandon, 7, and Zoey, 6. He wanted his kids, and the children he treated in the hospital, could see his welcoming grin and his confidence.</p>
<h2>Just What the Doctor Ordered: A Warm Smile</h2>
<p>Even beneath a mask, smiling with confidence lights up his face, a key boost when connecting with his small patients, many of whom are recovering from the effects of COVID-19. Many can only have one parent with them due to current hospital restrictions on visitors. It&#8217;s a frightening time for adults and for children, who are also coping with grave illnesses in addition to the pandemic.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3121" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7.png" alt="Dr. Chartan shows off his arm after his first COVID-19 vaccination dose." width="481" height="639" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7.png 1060w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7-226x300.png 226w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7-771x1024.png 771w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey7-768x1020.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;They know me as the person who always has a big smile and cares about my teeth. It&#8217;s a warming attribute,&#8221; he says, referring to the ability to smile warmly. He wanted to make sure he cared for his own smile as well as he cares for his patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an important member of their family, someone that the parents can confide in and the patient, the kids themselves, confide in,&#8221; he says. A warm, confident practice that puts young patients and their caregivers at ease is more important than ever.</p>
<p>Corey practices at the Texas Children&#8217;s hospital, which <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings">U.S. News &amp; World Report</a> has ranked as one of the top five hospitals nationwide.</p>
<h2>Teledentistry Made It Easy</h2>
<p>Corey found SmileDirectClub via the internet and was quickly sold on the idea by the ease of the process. He could take <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impressions</a> himself at home—and a dental expert would review his records and create his personalized plan—all without him having to schedule an appointment in person.</p>
<p>In his case, he only had to wear his aligners at night. He didn&#8217;t have to worry about visiting an office again or swapping out gear mid-shift.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3123" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9.png" alt="Corey with his family and two children on vacation" width="494" height="496" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9.png 1406w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-300x300.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-1020x1024.png 1020w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-150x150.png 150w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Corey9-768x771.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>With <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/introducing-nighttime-aligners-only-from-smile-direct-club/">Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, Smile Direct Club customers wear aligners for 10 hours while they sleep, instead of 22 hours during the day. SmileDirectClub 22-hour wear aligners must be removed before every meal, then cleaned and put back onto the teeth afterward. That&#8217;s tough for a doctor constantly on the go throughout his waking hours, with little time for breaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that you can do your impressions at home, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">get your updates at home</a>, have your entire box come to you at once and have it all lined up and ready for you, to continue on your path to get the straight teeth that you want—this is definitely a great company and one that I would recommend,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I already have recommended SmileDirectClub to friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not all Smile Direct Club clients qualify for Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, since they are mostly for mild to moderate straightening needs, and plans are so personalized. But for Corey, it was the best option.</p>
<p>He has a specialty in pediatric pulmonary hypertension, which examines elevated pressure in children&#8217;s lungs. It&#8217;s a rare specialty but one particularly valuable during a pandemic that can cripple the lungs. He is often called on to review records from patients who don&#8217;t even live in his state, and the value of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/covid-19-shines-a-spotlight-on-telehealth-what-it-is-and-how-it-works/">telemedicine and telehealth treatment</a> suddenly feels more real, and also very reliable. He appreciates SmileDirectClub&#8217;s ability to conduct reviews of all patient records remotely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;If you asked me about this six months ago, I might have had a different answer,&#8221; about teledentistry. &#8220;But I feel like this is almost the new way of practicing certain types of medicine—and potentially dentistry and orthodontics,&#8221; he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Proud, Smiling Dad</h2>
<p>And for all Corey&#8217;s concern about his patients, the power of a proud smile is personal for him, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like a big smile with pretty, perfect teeth,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s something that always has been important to me. It kind of translates from work to home, smiling like that, feeling good about yourself and life and that sort of positivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sees that translating to the attitude of his children as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I think having a big smile, and a warm smile, is important, but especially with my kids and my family.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rainer Dawn did not have time for braces.</p>
<p>Sure, his teeth were crooked. &#8220;My canines stuck out,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People called me &#8216;Sharkboy.&#8217; It was not ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3106" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5.png" alt="Rainer's smile before SmileDirectClub treatment" width="345" height="500" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5.png 660w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerB5-207x300.png 207w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></p>
<p>But Rainer, now 18, had braces for a few months during his <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/teens/">freshman year</a> of high school. His orthodontist was 45 minutes away, and he wasn&#8217;t always able to make the 90-minute round trip every month for adjustments. He&#8217;d also recently gotten his scuba diving license, was gifted some gear, and had the opportunity to visit family in Indonesia for a long scuba diving trip. Metal braces didn&#8217;t jibe with extended international travel, so he had to choose. He chose the once in a lifetime experience and had the braces taken off.<mark class="" data-mark-id="3bc517e0-81a6-483a-af92-dbb4ce983adc"></mark></p>
<p>By the time Rainer reached his senior year of high school, he hated his teeth. But he still didn&#8217;t want to wear braces. Braces made him look younger, he says, and he wasn&#8217;t having it.</p>
<p>Then Rainer saw a SmileDirectClub ad on Instagram. He clicked through for more information and liked what he saw: straight teeth in months instead of years, with no monthly orthodontist visits, and no metal mouth. And all at less than half the average <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a> of braces.</p>
<h2>He made an appointment that day</h2>
<p>Never one to hesitate, Rainer made an appointment for that day for an initial consultation at a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/">SmileDirectClub office</a> that was 20 minutes away from his home in Santa Cruz, California.</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour and a half later, I was walking into the office in San Jose,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I was just super impressed by the whole experience. I sat down in a fancy waiting room—there was kombucha on tap.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3110" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4.png" alt="Rainer shows off his aligners on a ski trip" width="610" height="420" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4.png 1378w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-300x206.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-1024x704.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA4-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>He was sold. He did his <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-image/">3D scan</a> and made a down payment that day. His purple box of standard clear aligners arrived at his door soon afterward. He wore his aligners as directed, at least 22 hours a day. His teeth got straighter after just three weeks of wearing his aligners. &#8220;It was a great feeling to see progress and know that you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Four months later, Rainer had the straight, white teeth he had always wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone from never smiling in photos to having a nice, big, wide smile in all my photos,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s changed the way I interact with people.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>He finished high school with straight teeth</h2>
<p>Rainer couldn&#8217;t believe how <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">easy</a> it was to get straight teeth.</p>
<p>His friends never noticed he was wearing aligners, and the discomfort was manageable. &#8220;It was just an amazing experience from start to finish,&#8221; Rainer says. &#8220;It was really simple to follow the instructions and stick with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He really loved not having to go to the orthodontist every month, like he had done when he had braces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3105" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA.jpg" alt="Rainer flashes his new smile after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="385" height="627" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA.jpg 1216w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-184x300.jpg 184w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-629x1024.jpg 629w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-768x1250.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA-944x1536.jpg 944w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /></p>
<p>Rainer&#8217;s mother, Erin, loved that he stuck with the plan this time. She had been hesitant to pay for SmileDirectClub aligners, even though they were <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/">affordable</a>, because she had already paid for braces for Rainier—$5,000 worth. She had not been thrilled when he insisted on taking them off so he could travel, but she had supported his decision.</p>
<p>But she was impressed with Rainer&#8217;s initiative in researching SmileDirectClub and then making the initial appointment himself. Even more impressive, Rainer had been working and saving up for a few years, so he was able to pay for the aligners upfront himself. Erin couldn&#8217;t be more proud of Rainer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;He stuck to the SmileDirectClub plan and was right on schedule changing out his aligners,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was gratifying to me to see how disciplined he was.&#8221; She credits SmileDirectClub&#8217;s treatment program with helping Rainer stay on track without her supervision. &#8220;I was impressed with how user-friendly it was,&#8221; she says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sees a change in her son now that his teeth are straight. “He smiles more. He has more confidence in public,&#8221; she says. &#8220;His dating life has improved, too.&#8221; <img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3107" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6.png" alt="Rainer poses in a professional photoshoot, showing off his new smile." width="397" height="594" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6.png 650w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/RainerA6-201x300.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /></p>
<p>Rainer finished his SmileDirectClub treatment plan the day he graduated high school. &#8220;I had worked so hard to get there, and to finish high school with straight teeth was an amazing, magical moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He plans to move to Los Angeles, where he wants to be an actor. &#8220;I really want to give it a shot and try to get into commercial work,&#8221; he says. &#8220;My new smile has made a massive difference in my life. I no longer have to worry about how I look when I smile because I have great teeth, which is just essential for that industry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2020 was a year of change for Diana Hairston, for so many reasons.</p>
<p>In January, the Baltimore mom of two young children, ages 4 and 1, and her husband, a musician, moved their family from a neighborhood she describes as riddled by crime and violence to a safer home, near the city&#8217;s Inner Harbor and sports stadiums downtown. She also landed a new job as a paralegal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3082" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM.png" alt="Diana with her family" width="682" height="450" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM.png 2132w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-300x198.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-1024x675.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-768x506.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-1536x1013.png 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.30-AM-2048x1351.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Everything was a fresh start —taking my children out of this bad area, starting a new job,&#8221; she says. That fresh start also inspired Diana to focus on something special for herself — something she had wanted to do for years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just before the pandemic closed down cities nationwide, Diana invested in something for herself — her smile.</p>
<p>She had three gaps in her teeth, she says, one in the center, and two large ones on the sides.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3083" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM.png" alt="Diana's smile - showcasing her main concerns for purchasing aligners" width="404" height="540" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM.png 1058w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM-224x300.png 224w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM-766x1024.png 766w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.03-AM-768x1026.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;If I turned to the side it looked like I had a missing tooth,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like to show my teeth a lot.&#8221; She would smile for photos only when she faced the camera — nothing to the side — so her gaps didn&#8217;t show.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was younger I used to have insecurities about it,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Growing up, Diana was one of six children in a family that didn&#8217;t have a lot of extra money. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to put the burden of braces on my parents growing up,&#8221; she explains.</p>
<p>And while her husband told her she looked beautiful, she still felt self conscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I became an adult I said, &#8216;OK, I can take care of my own finances at this point, I should be able to fix my teeth.'&#8221; Still, Diana worried about the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost/">cost</a> of traditional orthodontia.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub ads kept appearing on her Facebook page, she says, and the cost of $89 a month seemed affordable. She took her <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impressions</a>, and used the smile stretcher to take photos of all of her teeth, as SmileDirectClub suggests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I looked at the picture after I was done and I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m going through with it. I have to&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She sent both back to the company so SmileDirectClub dentists could review those along with her records, and plan her treatment. That was toward the end of February. Around the beginning of March, she received her first aligners.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Diana started sharing personal videos to document the silly toddler antics in her home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXQChvilP0&amp;t=31s">YouTube</a>. This year she added personal testimonials about her journey to a better smile and new confidence. She posted video blog entries of her experiences online. She had seen some negative feedback about SmileDirectClub, and saw that many potential customers had questions. Her videos aim to ease those concerns by walking viewers through her experiences at every point.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3085" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM.png" alt="Diana with her husband and two children" width="717" height="474" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM.png 2136w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-300x199.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-1024x678.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-768x508.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-2048x1356.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></p>
<p>In sum: The process and the aligners really do work. And the reactions she&#8217;s gotten to her videos have been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
<p>Diana&#8217;s advice to anyone interested in SmileDirectClub is to try it – and also make sure to follow the guidelines. In her case, she needed to wear her aligners <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">22 hours a day</a>, and she stuck to that. She wonders if perhaps those with negative experiences didn&#8217;t really follow the guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re investing in something you want to make sure you get the best out of it,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Sadly, the year hasn&#8217;t all been a happy, healthy restart. Diana, as well as several family members, caught COVID-1<img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3084" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM.png" alt="Diana smiling and showing off her results after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="453" height="384" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM.png 1662w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-300x254.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-1024x868.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-768x651.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.52.56-AM-1536x1301.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" />9, including her father, who was hospitalized. She&#8217;s lost some relatives to the disease, making this a rather difficult time.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;s tried to focus on the joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still able to say I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m healthy, I have two beautiful children, I have a job,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>And she has her smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people say your smile shows who you are. Before this, I didn&#8217;t smile as much because I was afraid to show my teeth. It feels bad when you&#8217;re around people and can&#8217;t show your true self because you&#8217;re ashamed of your hair or your teeth,&#8221; Diana says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Now I can show the joy around me.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transformation isn&#8217;t easy, but the payoffs — well, just look at those smiles.</p>
<p>Raquel Pryor and Ralph Walner live hundreds of miles apart. They&#8217;ve never met. Yet their stories of personal transformation share similarities. They&#8217;re both busy parents with full time professional jobs who were frustrated with their health and fitness levels, and wanted a change — from their smiles on down.</p>
<p>They both turned to running, to revamping their diet, and to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/results/">SmileDirectClub</a>, to reclaim their health and turn their confidence around.</p>
<h2>Like a Different Person</h2>
<p>&#8220;My journey was a whole lifestyle,&#8221; Ralph says. &#8220;I was pretty insecure about my teeth. Nobody ever said anything about them, but it was a thing to me. Every time I smiled in pictures or looked in the mirror, it was an issue for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3070" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-2-1.png" alt="Ralph Walner: before and after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="574" height="387" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-2-1.png 853w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-2-1-300x202.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-2-1-768x518.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p>Ralph lives in Houston and is an energy consultant, working with commercial buildings and national chains, managing utility contracts, and tracking building-wide energy consumption.</p>
<p>That professional environment, he says, also contributed to his swelling waistline. A few too many drinks out with colleagues, and lunches ordered in, and he estimates the scale hit 215 pounds instead of his svelte college weight around 175.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t focusing on myself, I was just focusing on my career. I looked in the mirror one day and I just wasn&#8217;t happy,&#8221; he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a shallow person, but toward myself I was being super shallow — &#8216;you shouldn&#8217;t dress like that because you don&#8217;t look fly.&#8217; It was a mental thing for me. If I lose the weight and fix my smile maybe I will be fly,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-3074" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-7-scaled.jpeg" alt="Ralph flashes his new smile inside the gym." width="371" height="495" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-7-scaled.jpeg 1920w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-7-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-7-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-7-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame-7-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" />His teeth were particularly important to him because as a child, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/pricing/">his family couldn&#8217;t afford braces for him</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up, I paid off my debts, I&#8217;m going to treat myself to SmileDirectClub,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The aligners that SmileDirectClub sent helped not just his teeth, but his weight loss efforts, too. Since the aligners need to be removed before a meal, and then washed before returning to their place, Walner had to plan out his eating schedule more carefully, which lead to planning his meals better, too. He also started running, returning to his high school passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I was doing SmileDirectClub, I was trying to get back to fitness and being healthy,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I lost about 40 pounds while I was also getting my teeth right. Honestly, I look like a different person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, he runs four to eight miles a day around central Houston and plans meals at least four days a week. He&#8217;s had his clothes tailored so they fit him perfectly, and he walks into those commercial buildings, smiling.</p>
<h2>The Khloe Kardashian Effect</h2>
<p>In 2018, Khloe Kardashian, one of the sisters in the famous celebrity family, announced that she had shed 60 pounds after giving birth to a child. Raquel Pryor isn&#8217;t a Kardashian devote, but found her inspiration: If Khloe Kardashian could drop the weight, so could she.</p>
<p>Pryor, a bookkeeper in the Bay Area of California, has two children, ages 1 and 5. She&#8217;s always been self-conscious about her smile, even if her friends and family told her they didn&#8217;t see any issues. And then there was her weight.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3071" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Before.png" alt="Raquel shows off her weight loss and smile transformation after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="638" height="713" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Before.png 1185w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Before-269x300.png 269w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Before-916x1024.png 916w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Before-768x858.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;For most of my adult life was overweight, and once you&#8217;re dealing with a bigger problem like weight — why would I fix my smile or my hair if I&#8217;m over 300 pounds,&#8221; she says. Raquel dreamed of being blonde. Once she started dropping weight, she finally took the plunge — and ordered her <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/how_it_works/">SmileDirectClub aligners</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by Kardashian, and just like Ralph, Raquel started focusing on exercise and diet, joining programs that helped her track both. She realized she couldn&#8217;t work out in the house — her older child would climb all over her, and render her workout secondary. She needed to find space and time alone, which meant leaving the house. She started running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Running is the worst thing ever when you&#8217;re 300 pounds,&#8221; due to the pounding on your body, she says. &#8220;It hurts.&#8221; But, she says, laughing, “I didn&#8217;t say you had to like it.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She just had to keep with it. She saw it not as an option, but a habit, a daily must-do. As she racked up the miles, her body, and her perspective, changed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-3075" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame6.png" alt="Raquel after SmileDirectClub aligners" width="401" height="500" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame6.png 1196w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame6-240x300.png 240w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame6-821x1024.png 821w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Frame6-768x958.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I love running now, but it&#8217;s taken three, four years to get there,&#8221; she acknowledges. She just ran her first 5K race this fall.</p>
<p>And she changed her smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who&#8217;s had to get dental work or braces, you can see it in pictures when they half smile or don&#8217;t really smile,&#8221; she says, citing her own self-consciousness about her teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pre-SmileDirectClub, I had a nice smile, but I didn&#8217;t like it.&#8221; Now, she says, &#8220;I can take pictures straight on.&#8221; No half smiles for her — she beams her full <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-to-use-bright-on-premium-teeth-whitening/">pearly whites</a>, as she jogs on down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>choose smile. choose proud.</strong></h2>
<p>High school student Gustavo Lopez III (Gus) wanted straighter teeth but didn’t want years of braces. Luckily, his supportive, close-knit family was on board to help him find a solution. And not only did his new smile make him look college-ready, it gave him an inner confidence he was proud to own.</p>
<p>Before, he’d constantly felt that other people were looking at his teeth and silently judging him. “I would still smile, but I can tell people noticed [my teeth] – and I noticed that. People would say, &#8216;Why haven’t you gotten braces?&#8217;”</p>
<p>Gus really wanted to straighten his teeth before his senior year but was told he’d need to wear braces through the first half of college. Many of his friends – all approaching their senior year of high school in greater Los Angeles – wore braces, and some had them for over 2½ years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“The experience looked awful. I did not want that.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When his father (Gus Jr. – aka Junior) asked the dentist about alternatives, “he gave us a ginormous price tag” for traditional aligner treatment. But then a friend at Junior’s gym said he’d worn SmileDirectClub aligners – and that he’d loved them.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2955 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Gustavo-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="472" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Gustavo-300x240.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Gustavo-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Gustavo-768x614.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Gustavo-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Gustavo-2048x1638.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><br />
<strong>Finding an option that the family could trust.</strong></h2>
<p>Gus’s family is tight – his grandmother lives with them, they all do a lot together, and they also make big decisions together. So when Gus had his 3D scan done at a SmileShop in Manhattan Beach, he took the entire family. Gus’s mom had braces when she was young and was a bit skeptical about how much treatment was included for the price of aligners. Everyone had questions.</p>
<p>But the manager did a great job of explaining how “your dentist will design and oversee Gus’s plan” – because one specific dentist really does direct an individual’s entire smile journey. And the family was pleasantly surprised that it would all be included in the price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“That conversation really took away any doubt,” says Junior. </strong><strong>“Knowing we could turn to someone specifically for guidance if we needed it.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gus was very proud showing off his 3D scan to his family and seeing how it reassured them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“I still have the pictures on my phone.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Proving his responsibility to his family – and himself.</h2>
<p>Before Gus started his treatment, Junior had many talks with him about sticking with the plan. “I wanted him to understand the gravity of the investment – not just short-term but long-term.” Gus was aware of the financial investment his family was making and let them know he was on board with the commitment.</p>
<p>When the purple box arrived, “It was like, okay, it’s time, I’m going to do it!” Gus says. And it turned out that he did a great job keeping up with his treatment – even at school. “After the first month, it was pretty easy.” Many kids didn’t realize for months that he was wearing aligners.</p>
<p>His father was beyond impressed. Says Junior, “He did a really great job following the process.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“He stuck to it. He didn’t lose one aligner. </strong><strong>I don’t think he fell out of the treatment plan once.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Seeing proof – and using it as motivation.</h2>
<p>Gus had his school picture taken right before he started treatment. That was his reference point for seeing changes – because though he could feel his teeth shifting, he didn’t really see it until later. Now, he sees a photo of himself in the family living room and can clearly make the comparison. He’s very proud of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“He’ll take you to the living room where his school portrait is hanging </strong><strong>and point out the differences,” says Junior.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a 6-month treatment plan, he loves his new smile – even if the pandemic means he can’t really show it off yet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2956 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Gustavo-285x300.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="537" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Gustavo-285x300.jpg 285w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Gustavo-971x1024.jpg 971w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Gustavo-768x810.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Gustavo.jpg 996w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<h2>Feeling confident in their choices – and in Gus’s new smile.</h2>
<p>“I see people struggle who don’t have straight teeth, and the lack of confidence some of them have,” says Junior. “As Gus goes to college and starts to build his own life, he’ll start out a step above.”</p>
<p>“I feel proud that we as parents made the right decision for him and his future.”</p>
<p>Gus is glad they trusted him. “I do feel more confident now that I don’t have to get those questions, ‘Do you need braces? Why don’t you have braces?’”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>“I’ll have a great smile for senior year, </strong><strong>and not go into college with anything but straight teeth.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>choose smile. choose change.</h2>
<p>Nursing student Chamani Gilmore found that straightening her smile didn’t just change the way others saw her. It changed her entire outlook and what she thought she could achieve. She’d put so much energy into helping others and serving her country – and now, she was finally doing something just for herself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2950 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Chamani_before-241x300.jpg" alt="" width="536" height="667" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Chamani_before-241x300.jpg 241w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Chamani_before.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /></p>
<p>Growing up in Baltimore, she was a good kid with good grades – and a gap between her front teeth that “was big enough to kick a ball through.” But she grew up in a family torn apart by domestic violence and was homeless for a time. Often, she had to be the adult, taking care of her mother, putting the family’s needs before her own. And braces were far from affordable.</p>
<p>So Chamani never smiled. She avoided cameras too. “I wouldn&#8217;t take a picture to save my life,” she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“I was constantly trying to not smile. </strong><br />
<strong>And it’s hard when you feel like you have to be in a shell.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But at 25, she decided to change her smile and her life.</p>
<h2><strong>Choosing to smile (for free!).</strong></h2>
<p>She began researching the cost of fixing her teeth. Braces were still beyond her reach. But a SmileDirectClub online ad, promising she could get her teeth straightened for less than half the cost of traditional braces, caught her eye.</p>
<p>Chamani took the plunge and ordered a SmileDirectClub impression kit. She made the molds of her teeth, sent them back, got a prescription, and began saving for the $200 down payment.</p>
<p>Then she got an email from SmileDirectClub inviting her to enter their Gift of Grin contest. If she could tell them in an essay why she deserved a new smile, she could win a free smile treatment. She entered.</p>
<p>“I wrote about how all my life I have done for other people.” Chamani shared how she took care of her mom when she was a kid. How, as an adult, she helped her mom escape her abusive father. And how she spent 3 years serving her country in the Air Force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Fixing my smile would be the first time I did something for me, </strong><br />
<strong>completely focusing on my joy and my happiness.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her essay won – and Chamani got her aligners for free.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2951 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_ChamaniJpg-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="513" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_ChamaniJpg-300x225.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_ChamaniJpg-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_ChamaniJpg-768x576.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_ChamaniJpg-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_ChamaniJpg-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Fixing her smile transformed her outlook.</strong></h2>
<p>Chamani saw results, fast.</p>
<p>“Right at the 1-month mark, my front teeth were almost touching,” she says. Her friends and co-workers noticed too. “People said, ‘Is your face changing? Are you changing your teeth?’”</p>
<p>When she finished her treatment, Chamani couldn&#8217;t believe the transformation. The aligners had closed that gap, and a couple of whitening treatments had made her teeth as bright as alabaster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“People tell me now that they didn&#8217;t talk to me because I never smiled. </strong><strong>It&#8217;s a shame how many interactions didn&#8217;t happen because of my teeth.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now she had a movie-star smile and every reason to share it.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding new confidence, relationships, and a career.</strong></h2>
<p>“Being uncomfortable with yourself is such a heavy burden,” she says. “I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have it anymore.”</p>
<p>Her new confidence gave her the courage to pursue her long-term goal of becoming a midwife. She has started nursing school in Wilmington, North Carolina, with plans to get an associate degree, transfer to a 4-year school for an undergraduate nursing degree, and then complete a 3-year midwifery program.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Changing my smile changed everything.</strong><br />
<strong>Now, anything I want to do, I have the confidence to do.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Fixing my smile has removed fear from my life,” Chamani says. “Since then, I&#8217;ve made more friends, I started school, I am in study groups, and all of these things are making me more successful. This is me moving forward in my life and taking the steps to be who I want to be.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>choose smile. choose freedom.</h2>
<p>Retired social worker Barbara Schaffner found that straightening her teeth could be done with all the freedom to suit her on-the-go lifestyle. And after putting so much into her family, it was the perfect time to do something just for herself.</p>
<p>Her smile had bothered her since childhood – and still, as a 59-year-old woman, “I was very self-conscious about my smile.”</p>
<p>One of her front teeth overlapped another one, and her bottom teeth were crooked. Also, food got caught in her misaligned teeth. &#8220;It was distracting. I was always running to the bathroom to clean my teeth.&#8221; When she was a child, her parents weren&#8217;t up for her getting braces. &#8220;I had my father&#8217;s front teeth, and he didn&#8217;t think there was anything wrong with me having them too,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>But the desire for a better smile – one she could really enjoy – never went away.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2944 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Barbara-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="455" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Barbara-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Barbara-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Barbara-768x512.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2_Barbara.jpg 1112w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“When you look back at old pictures, you think,</strong><br />
<strong>‘Why didn’t I do this sooner?’”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As she grew into adulthood and started a family, there was always something that took precedence over her teeth.</p>
<h2><strong>Ready to feel better about herself.</strong></h2>
<p>After she paid for all 3 of her children to wear braces, Barbara looked into getting braces or clear aligners for herself. &#8220;I remember getting my first estimate 8 or 9 years ago. It was like, $5000 after insurance,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I was like, &#8216;no way.’&#8221;</p>
<p>But she didn’t give up. She knew there had to be a less expensive way to straighten teeth. “You don&#8217;t need to go see an orthodontist every month,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>And she felt the time was finally right. &#8220;I decided to do my teeth now, at an older age, because my life is much more free than it was.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2945 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Barbara_Mehgan-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Barbara_Mehgan-225x300.jpg 225w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Barbara_Mehgan-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Barbara_Mehgan-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Barbara_Mehgan-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3_Barbara_Mehgan.jpg 1853w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“The children are raised, we’re traveling around.</strong><br />
<strong>Why not feel the best about yourself that you can?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in 2018 she saw an ad for SmileDirectClub, promising a straighter smile for less than $2000, with no monthly trips to an orthodontist’s office required.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding a treatment that fit her lifestyle.</strong></h2>
<p>Barbara had her initial 3D scan done at a SmileShop in Pittsburgh and then wore aligners for about 10 months.</p>
<p>The ease and convenience was a huge advantage. “We have 3 children, we have 6 grandchildren, and we’re on the road more than we’re home,” she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Just to be able to take care of your own teeth, with a professional behind you, </strong><strong>is much easier than making appointments and sitting in waiting rooms.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She and her husband also like to travel – through Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Aruba, and the Cayman Islands. She took her SmileDirectClub aligners with her. &#8220;We did a 6-week trip, and I couldn&#8217;t have done that if I was tied down with dentist&#8217;s appointments.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Getting exactly the smile she wanted.</strong></h2>
<p>The only time Barbara had to go back to the SmileShop was when she decided to extend her treatment plan. She felt that one of her bottom teeth was still sticking out more than she liked, so she reached out to SmileDirectClub Customer Care.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;They made sure I got what I needed.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They directed her to the SmileShop where she&#8217;d done her initial scan and made a few more weeks’ worth of aligners for her at no extra charge. She wore them till her tooth was aligned like she wanted.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2946 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4_Barbara--200x300.jpg" alt="" width="459" height="689" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4_Barbara--200x300.jpg 200w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4_Barbara--682x1024.jpg 682w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4_Barbara-.jpg 763w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /></p>
<h2><strong>Enjoying more confidence and freedom.  </strong></h2>
<p>When her aligners came off, Barbara&#8217;s smile was transformed – and so was her confidence. She doesn&#8217;t worry about how her teeth look anymore. She doesn&#8217;t duck and run from cameras. She doesn&#8217;t have to pick food out of her crowded teeth all the time. And after a SmileDirectClub whitening treatment, they’re brighter too.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of freedom because I don&#8217;t think about my teeth so much,&#8221; Barbara says. &#8220;I focus on other things, like my grandkids and my travels.&#8221; She loves that she&#8217;s changed her appearance for the better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;When you&#8217;re older, it&#8217;s nice looking in the mirror and seeing improvements.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things give one an ego boost like having Hollywood-worthy teeth.</p>
<p>Just ask Addie Sibley, 16. The high school sophomore is flashing a perfect smile after spending just four months in SmileDirectClub aligners. Talk about speed straightening. Addie&#8217;s crowded teeth have transformed into a gorgeous grin in just one semester of high school. She says that most of her friends have braces or another brand of clear aligners, and it took more than a year for their teeth to straighten. &#8220;So they&#8217;re shocked at how fast my teeth improved,&#8221; Addie says.</p>
<p>Her new smile has changed her life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Before, when I would be laughing, I would cover my teeth with my hand,&#8221; Addie says. “I would make sure people could only see me from certain angles, and I would always smile with my mouth closed.&#8221; Her days of hiding her teeth are over. “Now I smile with my mouth open, to show my teeth,&#8221; she says.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Family of Brighter (and Affordable) Smiles</h2>
<p>Her brother, Joey, 14, is wearing SmileDirectClub aligners too. He also had crowded teeth that were making him self-conscious. The eighth-grader started in treatment at the same time as Addie and completed treatment in May 2020.</p>
<p>The kids each chose different treatment plans. Addie got SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Clear Aligners, which she wore day and night for a treatment that took less than six months. Joey has Nighttime Clear Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. That means he wears them only at night, so his treatment takes longer (up to 10 months). The reason they took different paths? Addie was interested in finishing her treatment as quickly as possible, but Joey didn&#8217;t want to wear the aligners while playing sports. Both kids found a plan that fit their own priorities and schedule.</p>
<p>Before it all started, the Sibley teens <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/parents/">knew they wanted to do something about their smiles</a>, says their dad, Joe Sibley, an attorney in Austin, Texas. But when he took them to an orthodontist to look into getting braces, the price gave him sticker shock. The price quoted was $7,000 to $8,000 for a two-year treatment plan for both kids, with monthly office visits.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t fit with the family&#8217;s schedule or budget. &#8220;We were at a place of, &#8216;Do we really want to do it?'&#8221; Joe says. Because the only thing more expensive than braces for a teenager is braces for two teenagers.</p>
<p>But then Joe saw a commercial for SmileDirectClub and &#8220;a light went on,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I thought, it&#8217;s probably like everything else, that there&#8217;s an online solution that&#8217;s better than anything you find in a store.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Getting Two Teens Into Aligners</h2>
<p>Joe took Addie and Joey in for the initial 3D scan at a SmileShop in Austin, Texas. “We liked the relaxed feel of the place, and they answered all our questions,&#8221; Joe says. Even better was the price of the SmileDirectClub treatment plan, which was 60% less than traditional braces. &#8220;You could pay for a cruise to Alaska with the money we saved,&#8221; Joe says.</p>
<p>Addie and Joey saw improvements in their teeth as soon as they were done with their first set of aligners. &#8220;My smile looked better after a week,&#8221; Addie says. “You could really see it was moving my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took photos of her teeth three times a month, holding up her phone and snapping selfies to track her progress and stay motivated.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The photos inspired me to keep going,&#8221; she says. “Sometimes I didn&#8217;t want to put the aligners in. But I would look at the photos, see how much better my teeth looked, and keep going.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Addie and Joey say the aligners <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">were uncomfortable at first</a>, but they got used to them. <mark class="" data-mark-id="51932a7b-ccf3-40df-b72d-fbc31d26da06"></mark>Four months in, Joey can already see a difference — and so can his friends, because they&#8217;re telling him how good his teeth are looking. &#8220;It&#8217;s made me feel a lot more confident,&#8221; he says.</p>
<h2>A Household of Confident Kids</h2>
<p>Joe says he hasn&#8217;t had to be a helicopter dad to make sure the kids wear the aligners because the support they&#8217;ve gotten from SmileDirectClub staff has helped Addie and Joey manage their own treatment. &#8220;It&#8217;s been very user-friendly. We get the reminder emails that go out, telling them when to change the aligners,&#8221; he says. &#8220;To be honest, sometimes I forget (Addie and Joey) have (aligners.) I really don&#8217;t hear anything about them from either of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there have been sacrifices. No gum. No late-night snacks. But straight teeth are worth it. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be ready to try new things now that I feel better about my teeth,&#8221; Addie says. &#8220;My teeth were an insecurity of mine. They were holding me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joey says having straighter teeth is already making him more outgoing. &#8220;I&#8217;m more likely to talk to somebody if I&#8217;m not worried they&#8217;re judging my teeth. I feel a lot more secure about how I look.&#8221; Unlike his peers in braces, Joey doesn&#8217;t want wires glinting in his mouth whenever he speaks. Clear aligners let those straight teeth show sooner.</p>
<p>Joe says he&#8217;s delighted with the difference he sees in his kids&#8217; smiles and lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They have more confidence, and they are more comfortable speaking and smiling,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It makes me feel good as a parent because you want your kids to have all they need to be successful and happy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Alexandria is no stranger to challenges, so letting her smile hold her back was not an option.</h2>
<p class="headline-field js-story-headline js-commentable">For a beauty pageant contestant, a great smile can be as important as stage presence, self-confidence, and rhinestones.</p>
<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>Alexandria Hodnik had just started entering pageants around her native Staten Island, New York, and won the Miss Teen North America title when she realized her less-than-perfect smile might keep her from winning more crowns. &#8220;I had an overbite,&#8221; says the 19-year-old. &#8220;My right-top-front tooth was pushed out, and my bottom tooth was pushing all the way back. It was noticeable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexandria had already overcome a lot. The beauty queen has Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome, a form of autism. Entering pageants was a way for her to overcome the shyness and anxiety that comes with Asperger&#8217;s by building public speaking skills and confidence. And while she&#8217;d achieved those goals, she was now self-conscious about her smile — a huge liability on the pageant circuit.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2876 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-216x300.jpg" alt="" width="458" height="636" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-216x300.jpg 216w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-739x1024.jpg 739w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider-768x1065.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-Hider.jpg 1079w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I smiled with my mouth closed, and I was hesitant to smile,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was awkward, and it wasn&#8217;t showing my personality.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Braces were a no-go</h2>
<p>Her mother, Carolyn Gardner, looked into getting braces for Alexandria but decided against them. Alexandria has entered six pageants in two years. Besides the busy schedule that comes with pageant life, a doctor&#8217;s office visit a month would have been too much for her, Carolyn says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever we go to a doctor or dentist&#8217;s office, Allie gets very anxious,&#8221; Carolyn says. &#8220;She worries for days leading up to it. I didn&#8217;t think she would be a good candidate for a couple of years of monthly appointments in an office.&#8221; Plus, Carolyn&#8217;s own memories of braces weren&#8217;t positive. She wore metal bands on her teeth for three years that left them damaged, she says. &#8220;I remember feeling like a nerd, with all that metal in my mouth,&#8221; she says.</p>
<h2>SmileDirectClub gave her fast results</h2>
<p>Alexandria began her smile journey with SmileDirectClub, where she got started using their telehealth platform. Her mom saw a TV commercial, and they decided to check it out. She did her 3D scan at the SmileDirectClub office in Staten Island and started wearing her SmileDirectClub clear aligners in the summer of 2019. She felt better about her teeth almost immediately.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2869 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-292x300.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="554" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-292x300.jpg 292w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-998x1024.jpg 998w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-768x788.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;She stopped covering her mouth when she smiled,&#8221; Carolyn says. &#8220;She was much happier.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexandria went back to the SmileDirectClub office just once, to check the fit of the first set of aligners. Her treatment was overseen remotely by one of SmileDirectClub&#8217;s state-licensed dentists and she completed virtual check-ins with them along the way. She wore her aligners as prescribed by her doctor and saw her smile improve with each step.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub&#8217;s clear aligners let Alexandria keep modeling, something she couldn&#8217;t have done with a mouthful of metal braces. The aligners didn&#8217;t show, and she could take them out during a photo shoot. &#8220;They totally fit my activities as a model,&#8221; Alexandria says.</p>
<h2>And the award for great teeth goes to &#8230;</h2>
<p>Alexandria&#8217;s treatment took just six months. Once she was out of her aligners, she whitened her teeth with SmileDirectClub&#8217;s whitening kit, and the benefits of her gleaming, new smile were immediate. Alexandria won Miss Photogenic in the Teen North American pageant and the interview award in a second pageant. &#8220;I was so much happier with my smile, and it showed,&#8221; Alexandria says. &#8220;I have confidence in my mouth. My smile is better, and I love it. I like showing my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2872 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-167x300.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="765" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-167x300.jpg 167w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-768x1381.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3-854x1536.jpg 854w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hodnik-Smile-3.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" /></p>
<p>Her teeth will get her more than pageant prizes, though. Alexandria has an eye to a career in beauty, so she enrolled at the College of Staten Island, where she studies business. She wants to be a professional makeup artist and launch her own cosmetics line. Just like any challenge life has thrown her way, she&#8217;s ready to take it on without fear. But now, she has the added confidence of her new smile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;If you feel good about the way you look, your whole life gets better,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I realize that every time I smile and people tell me how good my teeth look. I want to make people feel good about themselves, too.&#8221;</p>
