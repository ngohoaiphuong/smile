<p>If you’re asking yourself, “How long does Smile Direct Club take to work?” we’re breaking it all down, from the 3D image or impression kit to maintaining your sparkling new smile with retainers.</p>
<h2><strong>How long does it take Smile Direct Club take to straighten teeth?</strong></h2>

Mail them back to us using the included prepaid label, and we’ll start creating your smile plan as soon as we receive and approve your impressions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3022 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IK-300x200.jpeg" alt="" width="537" height="358" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IK-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IK-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IK-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IK-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IK-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Smile plan</strong></h3>
<p>Within 72 hours of receiving your completed 3D scan or approved impression kit in the mail, you’ll get an email showing you your <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smile plan</a>, a projected outcome of what your new smile will look like.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1749 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/treatment-2.gif" alt="smile direct club plan" width="623" height="414" /></p>
<h3><strong>How long does Smile Direct Club take to ship?</strong></h3>
<p>Once you order your aligners, they are sent into production. Each of your aligner is custom-made especially for your smile plan, and you’ll receive all the aligners in your plan at one time to make your smile journey as easy as possible. Your aligners typically arrive at your doorstep in 4–5 weeks. Here are a few ideas for <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-to-do-while-you-wait-for-your-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what you can do while you wait for your aligners</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2203 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blog-Header-2_TS_1-28-2018.jpg" alt="" width="714" height="476" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blog-Header-2_TS_1-28-2018.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blog-Header-2_TS_1-28-2018-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blog-Header-2_TS_1-28-2018-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Retainers</strong></h3>
<p>When you’re about a month out from completing your smile plan, you’ll want to order your first set of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/dont-forget-your-retainers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom retainers</a>. Retainers are custom-made for your new smile and take 2–3 weeks to get to you. Wear your very first retainer set all the time for 2 weeks, just like you would your aligners. This means taking them out only when eating or drinking anything other than cool water. After the 2 weeks are up, or if this isn’t your first set, wear your retainers at night (for at least 8 hours).</p>
<p>Don’t forget to replace your retainers every 6 months to keep them clean, fresh, and tight-fitting to preserve your gorgeous new grin. Give our Customer Care team a call, and they can set up your account so you get your retainers every 6 months.</p>
<p>Are you ready to start your journey to a straighter smile? Take the free 30-second assessment today.</p>

<p><span class="TextRun SCXW232601690" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW232601690">SmileDirectClub is the largest provider of doctor-directed, remote clear aligners. Our aligners are convenient and up to 60% less than traditional braces. Say goodbye to brackets and wires and hello to a smile you’ll love with SmileDirectClub. </span></span></p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377120717?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<h3>What are aligners?</h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligners are made with Comfort Sense<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> technology to ensure that the aligners are comfortable. We create BPA-free clear plastic trays that fit snugly over teeth to gradually shift them into the desired position. SmileDirectClub aligner therapy includes several sets of custom-made aligners, worn for 1 to 2 weeks at a time to straighten your smile. This process takes, on average, 4-6 months. Each aligner will make slight adjustments to tooth position, advancing you to the next stage of your new smile. The process is mapped out in advance, and a SmileDirectClub affiliated, state licensed <a href="/doctors-behind-your-smile/">dentist or orthodontist</a> oversees each case.</p>
<h3>When are clear aligners better than braces?</h3>
<p>We work with 250+ state licensed <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/meet-your-dentist-smiledirectclub-q-dr-sulitzer/">dentists and orthodontists</a> utilizing SmileDirectClub&#8217;s teledentistry platform. Your treating doctor prescribes your smile plan, oversees your case, and will schedule regular virtual check-ins with you. By removing monthly in-office visits, we pass thousands of dollars in savings directly on to you. We work with many <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/insurance">insurance providers</a> directly and we also accept HSA, FSA, and CareCredit.</p>
<p>Braces typically correct more severe issues, whereas aligners work best for those with mild to moderate crowding, spacing, and general alignment concerns.</p>
<h3>Where do I start?</h3>
<p>If you’re at least 12 years old and have all of your permanent teeth, then you could be a candidate for SmileDirectClub. You can get started by visiting your local <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/">SmileShop</a> for a free 3D image of your teeth or purchase a doctor-prescribed, remote <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/">impression kit.</a></p>
<p>A straighter, brighter grin could be yours before you know it. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes! With remote teledentistry, you can straighten teeth from the comfort of your own home and under the guidance of a doctor.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes! With remote teledentistry, you can<strong> straighten teeth without traditional metal braces</strong> without monthly in-office visits and under the guidance of a state licensed dentist or orthodontist. SmileDirectClub aligners move teeth into place month by month like a puzzle, straightening smiles in an average of 4-6 months.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligner therapy includes several sets of tight-fitting, custom-made aligners that gradually shift teeth into their desired position. Every set of aligners in your treatment plan is shipped to you at once. No monthly shipments. No painful mouth full of metal. You&#8217;ll have all the tools you need to get the smile you&#8217;ll love.</p>
<h2><strong>How can you straighten teeth without braces in 3 easy steps?</strong></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px;">
<h3>1. Make a good first impression.</h3>
<p>First, we make a 3D image of your teeth to see exactly what&#8217;s going on and align your smile. There are 3 easy ways to make a 3D image: You can visit a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-is-smiledirectclub-smileshop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileShop</a> for an image of your smile, you can visit a local dentist or orthodontist in our Partner Network, or we can build it from the impressions you take using our doctor-prescribed <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impression kit</a>. A treatment plan is made using this 3D image, which is reviewed, approved, and prescribed by a state licensed <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dentist or orthodontist.</a></p>
<h3>2. Straighten your teeth without traditional braces.</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ll send you your entire treatment&#8217;s aligners directly to your door. Throughout treatment, you will have regular virtual check-ins with your doctor to monitor your progress. You&#8217;ll also have access to our 24/7 support and dental teams via video chat, phone, or email if you have any questions. We’ll also send you bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, our premium teeth whitening, so you can show off those pearly whites.</p>
<h3>3. Maintain your new smile with retainers.</h3>
<p>After periodically checking in with your doctor and completing treatment, you can purchase a set of <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/dont-forget-your-retainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retainers</a>. Wear them at night to keep your new smile in place. And you can order touch-up whitening treatments at any time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Everything you need to know about the Club Warranty.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How SmileDirectClub works to ensure you get the smile you&#8217;ll love.</h2>
<p>As the pioneer of doctor-directed aligner therapy, SmileDirectClub has helped more than 1,000,000 happy grinners smile confidently. Our customers get a straighter smile in as soon as 4-6 months. Each customer receives a 3D smile plan that shows how their teeth will move, month by month, when wearing SmileDirectClub aligners as directed. And as a member of the Club, if at the end of your plan you don&#8217;t love your smile, our SmileDirectClub warranty is here to help you out.</p>
<h3>How does the Club Warranty work?</h3>
<p>If at the end of your smile plan, you&#8217;ve followed the guidelines but haven’t achieved your desired smile, contact us so your state-licensed dentist or orthodontist can look into a Touch-up. You could be eligible for Touch-up if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear your aligners as prescribed and only remove when eating or drinking anything other than cool water.</li>
<li>Register your aligners.</li>
<li>Respond to virtual check-ins from your doctor by sending an email with the requested photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your Touch-up is approved, you may be eligible for additional aligners to continue your smile journey. Don’t forget: Reach out to us within 30 days of completing your smile plan for the warranty to remain valid. Give us a call at 800-848-7566  or send an email to <a href="mailto:dentalteam@smiledirectclub.com">DentalTeam@SmileDirectClub.com</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SmileDirectClub has increased underserved Americans' access to care by 84%!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 60% of counties in the U.S. don’t have an orthodontist’s office, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This means residents of these communities need to search for an orthodontist, take additional time off from work or school to travel to appointments, and then continue going back and forth for every follow-up visit. The good news? SmileDirectClub’s teledentistry model extends access to quality orthodontics to these underserved counties. In fact, SmileDirectClub has increased underserved Americans&#8217; <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teleorthodontics-and-access-to-care-at-least-84-percent-of-underserved-us-counties-now-have-access-to-orthodontic-treatment-300671890.html">access to care by 84%</a>!</p>
<p>Transforming your smile is easy and affordable with our invisible aligners. Since 2014, SmileDirectClub has helped 1 million Club members transform their smiles. We believe everyone deserves a smile they love – and it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult or expensive to do that.</p>
<h2>Why choose SmileDirectClub?</h2>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377120717?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<p>Nearly 80% of the U.S. population could benefit from orthodontic treatment, yet only 1% receives it each year. It&#8217;s not exactly convenient to take numerous days off work or school for appointments, not to mention the $4000–$8000 price tag attached to traditional orthodontics.</p>
<p>With SmileDirectClub, you can easily begin your smile journey by visiting one of our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/">SmileShops</a> or by having an <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/?w=impr">impression kit</a> mailed to your front door. We ship aligners straight to you, so you don’t have to worry about monthly appointments.</p>
<p>Removing the hassle of in-office visits, means those savings go directly to you. Our doctor-directed doctor-prescribed clear aligners cost up to 60% less than traditional braces. We work with a network of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/">250 state licensed dentists and orthodontists</a> to give you a smile you love.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1833 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dr-s-cropped-300x295.png" alt="Dr Sulitzer" width="300" height="295" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dr-s-cropped-300x295.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dr-s-cropped-768x755.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dr-s-cropped-1024x1006.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dr-s-cropped.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;SmileDirectClub&#8217;s teledentistry platform allows for more convenient access and flexibility for individuals who may not have access to local care,&#8221; says <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/meet-your-dentist-smiledirectclub-q-dr-sulitzer/">Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD, Lead Dentist at SmileDirectClub</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our network has over 225 duly licensed dentists and orthodontists with many years of experience with invisible aligners.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you’ve seen a post on social media, or you’re researching teeth straightening options on Google. Or maybe you’ve taken the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smile_assessment">first step</a> to determine if SmileDirectClub’s aligners are right for you and you’re asking yourself, <em>now what</em>? With the help of our state-licensed dentists and orthodontists, we’re here to explain the process and some of the benefits of teledentistry. So you can sleep, and smile, easy.</p>
<h2>How a doctor monitors your new smile.</h2>
<p>Whether you’ve completed your remote <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-make-good-first-impression">impression kit</a> or you&#8217;ve gone to a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=ELP&amp;utm_content=ELP/">SmileShop</a> for a 3D image, the basic process for making your new smile is the same for everyone. SmileDirectClub’s aligners are offered through a network of over 250 state-licensed dentists and orthodontists. These doctors have many years of aligner therapy experience. Each SmileDirectClub customer is assigned a dentist or orthodontist who is licensed where they live.</p>
<p>Your provider will assess your individual case, including your medical and dental history, and determine if SmileDirectClub aligners are the right fit for you. Then you&#8217;ll receive a 3D image of your new smile generated from your impressions or scan. We&#8217;ll create your individualized smile plan, ship your aligners, and remotely follow your progress all the way through the end of your smile journey. Your doctor will oversee your new smile, and schedule regular virtual check-ins with you.</p>
<h2>Who are the dentists?</h2>
<p>A Clinical Advisory Board guides SmileDirectClub&#8217;s network of dentists and orthodontists. In fact, the dentists and orthodontists in our network don&#8217;t work for SmileDirectClub at all. They can prescribe aligners to their customers, but they&#8217;re under no obligation to recommend SmileDirectClub&#8217;s aligners specifically.</p>
<p>The Clinical Advisory Board is responsible for the establishment of recommended clinical guidelines and best practices for SmileDirectClub aligners. The board makes recommendations to SmileDirectClub on its practices and services.</p>
<h2>Why teledentistry?</h2>
<p>Teledentistry is a more convenient and accessible option for most people. It also offers doctors the ability to provide more affordable options for orthodontic treatment. That’s why SmileDirectClub invisible aligners cost <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/pricing">up to 60% less</a> than traditional braces and other teeth straightening options. SmileDirectClub is a leader in promoting and developing advanced technology. We&#8217;ve also made it available to local orthodontists and general dentists while improving everyone’s access to care.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We define quality as the intersection of customer satisfaction and the Standards of Care. Our affiliated network will always do their absolute best to make customers happy with the results of their smile. We utilize the Standards of Care established by the dental professional community,” says Dr. Sulitzer.</p></blockquote>
<p>SmileDirectClub truly believes everyone deserves a smile they’ll love. We are proud to be pioneers in the teledentistry space. We, along with dentists and orthodontists, are helping increase access to individuals who thought straight teeth weren’t an option.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD, Lead Dentist at SmileDirectClub, answers your biggest questions about SmileDirectClub and straightening your teeth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Updated November 2020</em></p>
<p>Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD, is the Lead Dentist at SmileDirectClub. From the start of his career, Dr. Sulitzer aimed to impact oral health on a large scale. After graduating from the Temple University School of Dentistry in 1985, he spent more than a decade serving as Vice President of U.S. Healthcare’s dental division. Meanwhile, he continued to see his own patients in his private practice. Though his private practice afforded him the luxury of meeting patients in person, it was impossible for the dentist to see more than 15 patients daily, and Dr. Sulitzer was driven to access more people with different resources.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub provides a unique opportunity for him to improve the lives of thousands of people, and we’re thrilled to have him here. Dr. Sulitzer receives questions daily concerning everything from the results of your impression kits to the general health benefits of oral health. Below are 12 of your most commonly asked questions, as answered by Dr. S.</p>
<h2>Are there doctors affiliated with SmileDirectClub?</h2>
<p>Yes, every customer is assigned a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state licensed dentist or orthodontist</a> to oversee their case. Doctors affiliated with SmileDirectClub are state licensed orthodontists, or general dentists with orthodontic experience, who enjoy helping their patients achieve the smile their patients have always wanted.</p>
<h2>What are the most common signs that someone might benefit from SmileDirectClub invisible aligners?</h2>
<p>Two of the most common signs you might benefit from SmileDirectClub are (1) slight crowding and/or (2) spacing in your upper or lower front teeth. This could result from previous brackets/wires you had in the past: meaning your teeth have either become more crowded or more spread out than they were after your braces were taken off, or maybe you have not had braces before but would like to correct the natural crowding or spacing in your upper or lower front teeth.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of SmileDirectClub?</h2>
<p>SmileDirectClub is a great way to improve upon your smile in a way that fits your lifestyle. We can treat you under a doctor&#8217;s care without having you go to the orthodontic office once every 4–6 weeks. You can get the results you’re looking for, and the cost of our program is up to 60% less than traditional braces.</p>
<h2>I’m 13 years old. Is there a chance that my bite will improve on its own?</h2>
<p>It’s hard to say unless we can review your clinical information. I would recommend that you submit your information, and then we can see what is best for you.</p>
<h2>Why can’t children 12 years old and younger use aligners from SmileDirectClub?</h2>
<p>Aligner therapy is not an appropriate orthodontic therapy for children under 12, as they have more complicated tooth movement-needs that may involve their facial development. Children who are at least 12 years old and have all their permanent teeth may be a great candidate for SmileDirectClub.</p>
<h2>My child has early signs of orthodontic problems. Should we wait until he’s old enough to receive aligners from SmileDirectClub before correcting them?</h2>
<p>Most orthodontists recommend what we call “interceptive orthodontics,” which entail certain processes utilized by orthodontists to begin correcting tooth and jaw malalignments. Interceptive orthodontics are realized via conventional brackets/bands, rubber bands, appliances and “head gear.” Following an interceptive approach, the person may need more brackets/banding or may be a candidate for aligner therapy. This can be determined by reviewing the clinical information after the interceptive care is completed.</p>
<h2>It is normal for my permanent teeth to loosen during my new smile journey?</h2>
<p>Permanent teeth can become a bit loose during your aligner treatment, and this is not unusual. In fact, in many cases, it is part of the process. If you feel they are becoming “very” loose, however, or if they move more than you think is right, please reach out to us so we can correct any issue by finding out more about how you are progressing through your treatment.</p>
<h2>Is it normal to feel slight pain when wearing aligners?</h2>
<p>It is normal to feel <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/do-invisible-aligners-hurt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slight pain</a> when wearing aligners. In fact, it is a part of the process and tells us that it is working. In a few days after starting treatment, the pain will subside.</p>
<h2>Should I still see my regular dentist while on my new smile journey?</h2>
<p>You should continue to visit your regular dentist while you are working on your great smile with us. Dental cleanings and other treatments, if necessary, should continue while you are improving your smile. If you have any questions concerning additional dental needs, you should check in with us so we can coordinate the needed treatment with your regular dentist.</p>
<h2>Why are retainers needed after my new smile journey is complete?</h2>
<p><a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/dont-forget-your-retainers/">Retainers</a> are needed to prevent relapse. Without retainers, your teeth won’t stay in the nice, new position you have worked so hard to get them into. We recommend wearing your retainers for the first 2 weeks after completing treatment. Then, after 2 weeks, we suggest wearing them at night.</p>
<h2>Can you be too old for orthodontic treatment?</h2>
<p>You can never be too old for orthodontic therapy. In fact, I am 57 years old and starting my treatment shortly as I want to have a better smile, like the one I had after braces when I was only 16 years old.</p>
<h2>Are there foods to avoid during my new smile journey?</h2>
<p>As always, you should avoid eating any foods that are sticky and/or full of sugar, as they promote cavities. Most importantly, make sure you brush 3 times a day and floss once, each and every day.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Dr. Sulitzer! If you have any further questions concerning your new smile journey, please contact us at support@smiledirectclub.com.</i></p>
