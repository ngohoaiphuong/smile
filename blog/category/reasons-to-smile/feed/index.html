										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>Mari Andrew shares 4 tips for </strong><strong>smiling more</strong><strong> at work.</strong> </h2>



<p>In honor of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/celebrating-international-womens-day-with-the-women-of-smiledirectclub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Women’s Day</a> last month, we held a roundtable hosted by artist, writer, and speaker <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bymariandrew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mari Andrew</a>. Inspired by the discussion with 6 women from SmileDirectClub, she doodled this advice for smiling more at work.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get grinning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="788" height="763" class="wp-image-2502" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-be-happier-at-work-mari-andrew.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-be-happier-at-work-mari-andrew.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-be-happier-at-work-mari-andrew-300x290.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/how-to-be-happier-at-work-mari-andrew-768x744.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" />
<figcaption>Illustration by Mari Andrew</figcaption>
</figure>



<h3><strong>1. Bring your values to the office.</strong> </h3>



<p>Even if your current job isn’t your dream job, bringing your compassion, kindness, and new ideas can help you find what you’re passionate about, Andrew says. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
<p>“It’s a lot of pressure to find a career path that also aligns with your passions (it&#8217;s hard enough to find a career path, period!). But bringing your passion to your current work is a good way to learn more about your interests and talents – and where they converge.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h3><strong>2. Put personal touches on your desk.</strong> </h3>



<p>Personalize your space to make it both inspiring and smile-inducing. “I’m sensitive to my environment, so music, my desk, even my outfit make a huge difference,” Andrew says. Bring in a photo of your pet or loved ones, a cute succulent, or display a card from a co-worker. And, if you work in an open office, bring your headphones to really plug in and dial out distractions, she suggests.  </p>



<h3><strong>3. Celebrate others. </strong> </h3>



<p>Smile more with coworkers by celebrating both the little things and the big things, from workiversaries and birthdays to engagements and babies, to remind them how great they are. “We assume that our wonderful friends and colleagues know exactly what it is we value in them and why they’re special, but people could be reminded of their talents daily, and it wouldn’t be enough!” </p>



<h3><strong>4. Lift up your peers.</strong> </h3>



<p>A few kind words can go a long way to brighten someone’s day.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
<p>“Everyone can feel a little uneasy at work. Even when they’re killing it, sometimes it just feels so good to hear ‘great idea today,’ or ‘thank you for getting back to me so quickly,’ or ‘I always appreciate your insights during meetings.’ I try to give one compliment a day, at least.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h3><strong>Plus</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> a bonus tip: Get outside.</strong> </h3>



<p>Sometimes all you need to turn your frown upside down is a change of scenery and some vitamin D. “I&#8217;m personally a big believer in walks and journaling to reconnect with yourself regularly,” Andrew says. “When I worked at an office, I’d use my lunch hour to take a long walk, and now that I work from home, I carve out an hour in my day just to walk around my neighborhood to clear my mind and just spend some time appreciating my own company.” </p>



<p>There’s one more thing that can help you smile more at work – and just in general: <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/amys-incredible-smile-transformation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a smile you love (opens in a new tab)">a smile you love</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[ Read on for a glimpse of her big day – and how she got a smile that will shine brightly for years to come. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>&#8220;Now that my smile plan is complete, I can say my smile is brighter and straighter!” Patty says. “I loved the SmileDirectClub journey and can only speak positives about my experience. I’d recommend everyone try it!”<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h2>
<p>As CEO and founder of You Evolve Hair, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/patty.pepper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patty Pepper</a> is always changing up her look and is all about living a confident, positive life.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>Patty wore <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-are-invisible-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileDirectClub aligners</a> before she walked down the aisle during her dream wedding to her husband, D&#8217;Juan, last June. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I love smiling, so finding a way to keep my smile straight and <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/whitening-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bright</a> for my wedding day was such a great feeling!&#8221; she says. &#8220;The best part was it was <strong>easy and convenient</strong>!&#8221; <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>Patty shared her <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/your-wedding-beauty-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-wedding routine</a> exclusively with SmileDirectClub. Read on for a glimpse of her big day – and how she got a smile that will shine brightly for years to come.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3>Preparing for the wedding</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1773 size-large" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-11.04.21-AM-774x1024.png" alt="" width="774" height="1024" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-11.04.21-AM-774x1024.png 774w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-11.04.21-AM-227x300.png 227w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-11.04.21-AM-768x1016.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-11.04.21-AM.png 906w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></p>
<p>Shortly after getting engaged, Patty began her journey with SmileDirectClub by doing an <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/checkout/?w=impr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impression kit</a>. She was able to straighten and whiten her teeth from the comfort of her own home before the big day. She also boosted her beauty routine about 6 months before the wedding with regular massages and facials. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>Patty used at-home mint julep masks and body wraps to help her look and feel her best. By wearing custom wigs from her company, You Evolve Hair, she was able to change her style without damaging her hair.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I experimented a lot with different hairstyles and protective styling,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I love big hair with lots of volume. It&#8217;s so much fun to be versatile!&#8221;<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>Her bridesmaids and mom helped her to capture the final hair and makeup look for her wedding day. While prepping and planning for her wedding, she was able to get the smile of her dreams in a few short months.</p>
<p>The engagement period is also the ideal time to whiten your teeth – put that <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/whitening-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium whitening gel</a> and <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/teeth-whitening-led-accelerator-light" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED accelerator light</a> to work.</p>

<p><script async defer src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>The weekend of her wedding, Patty invested in a gel manicure and pedicure. She chose a Cinderella-themed color with silver and glitter – perfect for her Disney wedding.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>On her wedding day, Patty was well equipped with an emergency beauty kit that included mini deodorant to keep any unwanted sweat under control and a small pack of tissues to touch up makeup after any happy tears. Other day-of essentials: breath mints, lip color, blotting papers, and a stain-removing pen. One thing she didn&#8217;t have to worry about was her smile.</p>
<p>Celebrity makeup artist Jo Michelle Artistry perfected Patty&#8217;s look with MAC SPF Full Coverage Foundation and Prep + Prime Face Protection Lotion. D&#8217;Juan chose Chanel No. 5 perfume for Patty to wear – a classic, elegant fragrance to complement her princess dress and tiara.</p>
<p>On June 27, 2017, Patty and D&#8217;Juan tied the knot in their very own fairy-tale wedding at Walt Disney World. Their love was on full display in the most magical celebration. Patty&#8217;s smile was as radiant as she had always dreamed of, but it was her <strong>confidence, happiness, and passion</strong> that made that day so very special. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now that my smile plan is complete, I can say my smile is brighter and straighter!” Patty says. “I loved the SmileDirectClub journey and can only speak positives about my experience. I’d recommend everyone try it!”<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>College is expensive. SmileDirectClub aren’t. Help your college student</strong><strong> succeed with the gift of new smile.</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve already saved up and shelled out for tuition, room and board, books, and dorm decor. The last thing you want to do is open your wallet again. But if you’re already sending baby bird out of the nest and into the real world, you might as well send them out with confidence. Here are 5 reasons why SmileDirectClub clear aligners are a good investment for your college students.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377122844?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<h3><strong>1. SmileDirectClub is completely doctor-directed.</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doctor-directed</a>, doctor-prescribed <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-things-parents-know-teen-braces-smile-direct-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aligners</a> may be the perfect solution for your teen’s active lifestyle. The custom-made aligners are removable, meaning there are no food restrictions, and keeping teeth clean is a cinch. And a state licensed dentist or orthodontist is with your teen every step of the way, monitoring their progress and making sure their teeth are moving according to plan and will check in remotely.</p>
<p>Plus, our Dental Team is available via video, phone, email, and chat to answer any treatment questions you have. And since SmileDirectClub can be done completely remotely, there are no office visits to worry about missing. But we can&#8217;t make any promises about not missing classes.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Monthly payments are less than your child’s cell phone bill.</strong></h3>
<p>Give them a smile they’ll love for much less than traditional braces. The best part: We work with plenty of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/insurance/">insurance providers</a>, and even accept <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/you-can-use-your-hsa-or-fsa-purchase-your-invisible-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSA, FSA</a>, and <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-does-carecredit-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CareCredit</a>. No credit checks. No forms to fill out.</p>
<h3><strong>3. You&#8217;ll boost their confidence instantly.</strong></h3>

					<description><![CDATA[Back-to-school hacks to help you ace the semester with SmileDirectClub.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Back-to-school hacks to help you ace the semester with SmileDirectClub aligners.</h2>
<p>Whether you’re heading off to college for the first time or back to the hallowed halls of high school once again, wearing aligners at school is easy. There’s no reason you can’t enjoy late-night trips to the neighborhood diner, date parties with your campus crush, or weekends on the road with your sports team. These 8 easy tips will keep you grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<h3>1. Be ready to avoid potentially awkward situations.</h3>
<p>At some point in time the professor will bring in coffee and donuts, or the teacher will order pizza for class, someone will bring in an allergy-friendly treat to share, etc. No worries; you can eat whatever you want wearing aligners. This is your time to sneak off to the bathroom with your case to discreetly remove your aligners, or save a treat to take home with you for later. Don’t forget to stop by the bathroom again after class for a quick brush and to pop your aligners back in.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2423" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bridesmaids.gif" alt="bridesmaids" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/120B9ojZynuKKA/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>2. Get a quality bag for your essentials.</h3>
<p>Invest in a cosmetics case or small bag that you can stash in your backpack. Having a bag with you makes it quick and easy to clean your mouth and aligners after meals, drinks, and snacks.</p>
<h3>3. Chew on Movemints.</h3>
<p>Going to a dance or date party? You can chew on these dental mints while wearing your aligners. They’ll keep your breath fresh and clean, helping you feel confident all night long. Plus, they help give your aligners a tighter and more comfortable fit. You can<a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/"> stay stocked up on mints</a> by ordering directly through our website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1730" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/back-to-school-aligners-demi.gif" alt="wearing aligners at school" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/p2qsWFW2aM30k/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3> 4. Only drink (cool) water with your aligners in.</h3>
<p>This could be a tricky one for coffee connoisseurs – even worse if you depend on a strong cup of joe to get you through your work day. Rather than sipping on your cold foam cappuccino slowly all morning, we suggest drinking it with breakfast and then cleaning your teeth immediately after. (And stick to 1 or 2 games of flip cup on the weekend – if you’re over 21, of course.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2421" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/twins.gif" alt="drinking water" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2S03OiGhhUXpII/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>5. Use mild dish soap to clean ‘em.</h3>
<p>Aligners are easy to clean, too. A mild dish soap or a mixture of water and baking soda does the trick. Pop your aligners in the cleaning solution or into your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/smilespa">smile spa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> while you get ready in the morning.</p>
<h3>6. Schedule regular dental visits every 6 months.</h3>
<p>Our aligners are completely doctor-directed. Every SmileDirectClub customer is assigned a state licensed dentist or orthodontist who remotely monitors their progress. We&#8217;ll schedule virtual check-ins with your doctor to monitor your progress. It’s also important to continue seeing your local dentist every 6 months for regular cleanings. Schedule those visits now so you don’t forget to go when you’re back home over breaks.</p>
<h3>7. Munch on healthy snacks.</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with the occasional Cheetos and Oreos – sans aligners – but if you want to boost your oral health (and avoid the freshman 15), pick the right snacks. The calcium in almonds can help strengthen your teeth, while the malic acid in strawberries can help whiten your teeth’s enamel and may even protect against oral cancer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1712" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ron-1.gif" alt="" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/X16zGX3XLvLe8/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>8. Bring your aligner case with you everywhere.</h3>
<p>Do not, we repeat do not, wrap your aligners in a napkin while eating in the dining hall. The napkin will inevitably end up in the garbage, along with your cherished aligners. Your SmileDirectClub blurple aligner case will be your new best friend.</p>
<p>In just 4-6 months, a straighter, brighter smiles could be yours. Get a smile you&#8217;ll love by spring break. Click the link below to start your smile journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The 1-year &#8216;Get Gorgeous Plan&#8217; for the big day.</h2>
<p>Congratulations on your engagement! Planning for a wedding can feel overwhelming, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. We&#8217;ve broken down a checklist with a timeline to help you stay on track.</p>
<p>(And remember: Your fiancé already loves you the way you are! Show off your smile with confidence on your big day and soak up every moment of your wedding.)</p>
<p><strong>1 year before your wedding day</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get the smile of your dreams in time for your wedding day! One year before you say &#8220;I do,&#8221; visit your local <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileShop</a> for a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-scan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D image</a> or order an <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout">impression kit</a> to start your smile journey. Our average customer sees results in just 6 months.</li>

	</p>
<p><strong>9 months to go</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Submit photos through our dashboard for your virtual check-ins with one of our state-licensed dentists or orthodontists. They&#8217;ll make sure your smile is moving on track.</li>
<li>Make sure you keep wearing your aligners all day and night (or 10 consecutive hours for Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), except when eating and drinking.</li>
<li>And while you&#8217;re at it, now is a great time to visit a dermatologist, get a facial, and amp up your routine for glowing skin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6 months to go</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After 6 months, you might complete your smile plan. Maintain that gorgeous grin by ordering your retainers. You&#8217;ll want to wear them all day and night for the first 2 weeks, and then every night after that to prevent your new smile from shifting back to where it used to be.</li>
<li>Do your first <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/whitening-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium whitening treatment</a>. Apply the whitening gel pen to your teeth and then use the LED light to intensify the whitening effect. Results last up to 6 months.</li>
<li>Now is a good time to book your wedding week beauty appointments, too – hair, makeup, and any manicures or waxing you plan to get.</li>

<li>Take care of any waxing.</li>
<li>Treat yourself to another <a href="https://www.self.com/gallery/pre-wedding-skin-treatments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facial</a>. Stay away from any peels and stick to a gentle treatment.</li>
