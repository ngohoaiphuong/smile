										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>College is expensive. SmileDirectClub aren’t. Help your college student</strong><strong> succeed with the gift of new smile.</strong></h2>
<p>You’ve already saved up and shelled out for tuition, room and board, books, and dorm decor. The last thing you want to do is open your wallet again. But if you’re already sending baby bird out of the nest and into the real world, you might as well send them out with confidence. Here are 5 reasons why SmileDirectClub clear aligners are a good investment for your college students.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377122844?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<h3><strong>1. SmileDirectClub is completely doctor-directed.</strong></h3>
<p>Our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doctor-directed</a>, doctor-prescribed <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-things-parents-know-teen-braces-smile-direct-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aligners</a> may be the perfect solution for your teen’s active lifestyle. The custom-made aligners are removable, meaning there are no food restrictions, and keeping teeth clean is a cinch. And a state licensed dentist or orthodontist is with your teen every step of the way, monitoring their progress and making sure their teeth are moving according to plan and will check in remotely.</p>
<p>Plus, our Dental Team is available via video, phone, email, and chat to answer any treatment questions you have. And since SmileDirectClub can be done completely remotely, there are no office visits to worry about missing. But we can&#8217;t make any promises about not missing classes.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Monthly payments are less than your child’s cell phone bill.</strong></h3>
<p>Give them a smile they’ll love for much less than traditional braces. The best part: We work with plenty of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/insurance/">insurance providers</a>, and even accept <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/you-can-use-your-hsa-or-fsa-purchase-your-invisible-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HSA, FSA</a>, and <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-does-carecredit-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CareCredit</a>. No credit checks. No forms to fill out.</p>
<h3><strong>3. You&#8217;ll boost their confidence instantly.</strong></h3>
<p>Studies have shown that smiling can boost your mood on the spot. Plus, those who smile tend to be (or at least appear to be) more confident. Help them <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/8-tips-for-wearing-your-invisible-aligners-when-you-head-back-to-school/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ace the semester in the classroom</a> and beyond with a straight, bright smile they’re truly proud of.</p>
<div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/377416282?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0" width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></p>
<h3><strong>4. SmileDirectClub is safe and effective. </strong></h3>
<p>SmileDirectClub aligners shift teeth into their desired position in an average of 4-6 months. That means your student could have a new, straight smile by spring break. Don’t just take our word for it. Check out real customer reviews and see their pearly grins <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>5. You’ll help prepare them for job interviews.</strong></h3>
<p>Forty-eight percent of adults think a smile is the most memorable feature after they meet someone for the first time. Not only that, but 25% of survey respondents think someone with crooked or stained teeth is less confident.</p>
<p>While student loans can take years to pay off, the payoff of a new, straight smile happens right away. Get started today.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Back-to-school hacks to help you ace the semester with SmileDirectClub.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Back-to-school hacks to help you ace the semester with SmileDirectClub aligners.</h2>
<p>Whether you’re heading off to college for the first time or back to the hallowed halls of high school once again, wearing aligners at school is easy. There’s no reason you can’t enjoy late-night trips to the neighborhood diner, date parties with your campus crush, or weekends on the road with your sports team. These 8 easy tips will keep you grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<h3>1. Be ready to avoid potentially awkward situations.</h3>
<p>At some point in time the professor will bring in coffee and donuts, or the teacher will order pizza for class, someone will bring in an allergy-friendly treat to share, etc. No worries; you can eat whatever you want wearing aligners. This is your time to sneak off to the bathroom with your case to discreetly remove your aligners, or save a treat to take home with you for later. Don’t forget to stop by the bathroom again after class for a quick brush and to pop your aligners back in.</p>

<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/120B9ojZynuKKA/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>2. Get a quality bag for your essentials.</h3>
<p>Invest in a cosmetics case or small bag that you can stash in your backpack. Having a bag with you makes it quick and easy to clean your mouth and aligners after meals, drinks, and snacks.</p>
<h3>3. Chew on Movemints.</h3>
<p>Going to a dance or date party? You can chew on these dental mints while wearing your aligners. They’ll keep your breath fresh and clean, helping you feel confident all night long. Plus, they help give your aligners a tighter and more comfortable fit. You can<a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/"> stay stocked up on mints</a> by ordering directly through our website.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1730" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/back-to-school-aligners-demi.gif" alt="wearing aligners at school" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/p2qsWFW2aM30k/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3> 4. Only drink (cool) water with your aligners in.</h3>
<p>This could be a tricky one for coffee connoisseurs – even worse if you depend on a strong cup of joe to get you through your work day. Rather than sipping on your cold foam cappuccino slowly all morning, we suggest drinking it with breakfast and then cleaning your teeth immediately after. (And stick to 1 or 2 games of flip cup on the weekend – if you’re over 21, of course.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2421" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/twins.gif" alt="drinking water" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3q2S03OiGhhUXpII/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>5. Use mild dish soap to clean ‘em.</h3>
<p>Aligners are easy to clean, too. A mild dish soap or a mixture of water and baking soda does the trick. Pop your aligners in the cleaning solution or into your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/smilespa">smile spa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> while you get ready in the morning.</p>
<h3>6. Schedule regular dental visits every 6 months.</h3>
<p>Our aligners are completely doctor-directed. Every SmileDirectClub customer is assigned a state licensed dentist or orthodontist who remotely monitors their progress. We&#8217;ll schedule virtual check-ins with your doctor to monitor your progress. It’s also important to continue seeing your local dentist every 6 months for regular cleanings. Schedule those visits now so you don’t forget to go when you’re back home over breaks.</p>
<h3>7. Munch on healthy snacks.</h3>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with the occasional Cheetos and Oreos – sans aligners – but if you want to boost your oral health (and avoid the freshman 15), pick the right snacks. The calcium in almonds can help strengthen your teeth, while the malic acid in strawberries can help whiten your teeth’s enamel and may even protect against oral cancer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1712" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ron-1.gif" alt="" width="788" height="525" /></p>
<p><a style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px; float: right;" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/X16zGX3XLvLe8/giphy.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via GIPHY</a></p>
<h3>8. Bring your aligner case with you everywhere.</h3>
<p>Do not, we repeat do not, wrap your aligners in a napkin while eating in the dining hall. The napkin will inevitably end up in the garbage, along with your cherished aligners. Your SmileDirectClub blurple aligner case will be your new best friend.</p>
<p>In just 4-6 months, a straighter, brighter smiles could be yours. Get a smile you&#8217;ll love by spring break. Click the link below to start your smile journey.</p>
