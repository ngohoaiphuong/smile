										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve tried everything possible to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">make your aligners more comfortable</a>, but there is one spot that is still bothering you. So, you decide to give SmileDirectClub a call and our dental team suggests that you trim and file the area. But, how do you even do that?</p>
<p>Watch SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Dr. Riddhi walk you through the process below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOd1jpbCoGc" width="840" height="472.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>If the dental team advises you to trim and file your aligners, Dr. Riddhi suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use cuticle scissors, so you can make the smallest trim possible.</li>
<li>Trim as per the directions of the dental team, you can request a video call with them to walk you through it.</li>
<li>Once trimmed, use your emery board to file that area. Remember to buff in the same direction to reduce rough edges!</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: you can always take off, but you can&#8217;t put any back! So, take it slow while trimming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>by Riman Aburoumi</i></p>
<p>I never liked my smile. I had a gap between my two front teeth that made me self-conscious.</p>
<p>Growing up, braces weren&#8217;t an option because my parents couldn&#8217;t afford them. I had just decided to accept my teeth—but then a guy I work with told me about SmileDirectClub.</p>
<div id="attachment_3156" style="width: 339px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3156" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3156" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before.png" alt="" width="329" height="470" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before.png 806w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before-210x300.png 210w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before-716x1024.png 716w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-before-768x1098.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3156" class="wp-caption-text">Riman before starting aligners.</p></div>
<p>He had a really big gap between his teeth, too. He got SmileDirectClub aligners, and after a month or so wearing them, he came to me and said, &#8220;Hey, look at this!&#8221; He took out his aligners, and the gap in his teeth was shut. I could not believe his teeth looked that good that fast. His gap had been bigger than mine, and it was gone.</p>
<p>I knew right then I had to try this. I booked an appointment that day for a 3D scan at a SmileShop in a CVS near where I live in New Jersey. I got my scan done the next day, first thing in the morning. It was really quick and really cool, and the lady there guided me through everything. I got my aligners a month later, in December 2019.</p>
<h2>Five months to a better smile</h2>
<p>I waited till the new year to start my treatment, so I put in my first aligners in January 2020. My teeth hurt for the first two weeks, but I stuck with it because I knew having a better smile would be worth the discomfort. Beauty is pain! Besides, my co-worker had told me the aligners would hurt in the beginning, so I wasn&#8217;t surprised.</p>
<p>I wore the 22-hour aligners, and the hardest part of having them was taking them out every time I wanted to eat something. It was such a new experience, but my co-worker was my mentor. I asked him so many questions. He gave me tips on the whole eating and drinking process and how to clean the aligners. I&#8217;m an EMT, and I was wearing my aligners during the peak of the COVID pandemic in New Jersey and New York. I was working in full PPE gear—respirator, face shield, the works—so my aligners were just one more item to put on and take off.<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3157 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2.jpeg" alt="" width="456" height="511" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2.jpeg 884w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2-267x300.jpeg 267w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Riman-after-2-768x862.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></p>
<p>I took lots of selfies so I could see the changes in my teeth. I could see a difference after a month of wearing aligners. Three months into my treatment, the gaps in my teeth were closed. It was crazy how fast my smile improved. My treatment was finished in just five months. I look at my before-and-after pictures, and it&#8217;s amazing how fast the improvements happened with my teeth and how much better they look. My friends and family all tell me how good I look.</p>
<h2>But could they be even better?</h2>
<p>I was so excited about my new smile. But I did notice that when I took out my last aligner, I could still feel little gaps in my teeth. People couldn&#8217;t really see them when I smiled, but I could feel them. I thought that maybe they could be a little tighter and closer. SmileDirectClub has a warranty that says if you&#8217;re not happy with the results, you can extend your treatment at no cost. I was hesitant to ask for more aligners because I thought I was being selfish or greedy. I was happy with my teeth. My smile looked great. But a little voice in my head kept saying, &#8220;What if it could be even better?&#8221;</p>
<p>After two or three months of wondering about it, I emailed SmileDirectClub customer service and asked them if I could do a touch-up treatment. I thought maybe my teeth looked too good to qualify for the warranty, but I figured it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to ask.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3158 aligncenter" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-2.25.27-PM.png" alt="Riman's before and after." width="639" height="276" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-2.25.27-PM.png 1666w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-2.25.27-PM-300x130.png 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-2.25.27-PM-1024x443.png 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-2.25.27-PM-768x332.png 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-2.25.27-PM-1536x664.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></p>
<h2>Easy, free touch-up aligners</h2>
<p>The SmileDirectClub people were great. There was no hassle. They were glad that I was generally happy with my new smile, and they seemed excited to help me get them exactly the way I wanted them. They asked me to send photos of my teeth, and I did. They sent me an impression kit immediately, which I did and returned. In less than three weeks, I had two months of new aligners to extend my treatment and push my teeth a little closer together—all for free.</p>
<p>I am so glad I sent that email. I&#8217;ll be done with my touch-up treatment in time for my wedding in June. I can&#8217;t wait to smile big for our photos on the big day. I already know how perfect my smile will look—now I know it&#8217;ll <em>feel</em> perfect, too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad I did SmileDirectClub. Both my original treatment and my getting my touch-up aligners were smooth and simple. Your smile is a big deal, and if you&#8217;re even a little bit unhappy with your teeth, you should do SmileDirectClub. I&#8217;m so much more comfortable with how I look now that I fixed my teeth. I smile more, I talk more, and I don&#8217;t worry that people are looking at the gap in my teeth. I love my teeth now. I&#8217;m so glad I decided to take the last step of getting my touch-up aligners. It was so worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>You&#8217;ve begun your Smile Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.  After wearing your aligners every day for weeks, you can already see a dramatic change in your teeth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re thrilled.</p>
<p>A friend of yours has made great progress with their aligners, too, and they&#8217;re only wearing them at night. That sounds like something you&#8217;d like to try—having to take them out every time you eat is getting a little inconvenient. And if it&#8217;s working for your friend, why not for you, right?</p>
<p>Hold up! Your treatment plan is customized, specific, and extremely important to follow to the letter. The same goes for if you&#8217;re wearing <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/introducing-nighttime-aligners-only-from-smile-direct-club/">Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> and want to try wearing them all day to move things along. Using your 22-hour SmileDirectClub Aligners as Nighttime Aligners or vice versa could slow your progress toward the smile of your dreams—not speed it up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h2>Moving teeth is serious science</h2>
<p>The science of moving teeth isn&#8217;t as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>See, Nighttime Aligners and standard SmileDirectClub Aligners are different. Sure, they may look alike. But each type of aligner is a highly specialized device designed to make precise adjustments to tooth position.</p>
<p>Nighttime Aligners are designed to move crooked teeth into a perfect smile in an average of 8-10 months and require at least 10 hours per day of continuous wear at night. SmileDirectClub Aligners are designed to move teeth in 4-6 months and require 22 hours of wear per day.</p>
<p>Your assigned doctor is a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist who was assigned to you to manage your specific alignment needs. They&#8217;ve used their expertise to create <em>your</em> treatment plan for <em>your</em> teeth. They&#8217;ve calculated exactly how much pressure the aligners will apply to each tooth and for how long. And the amount of time your aligner is out of your mouth is a part of the equation, too. Diverging from your treatment plan can disrupt that careful calculation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3147" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1.jpeg" alt="SmileDirectClub doctor" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1.jpeg 1920w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>And keep in mind, your smile is unique. The way your teeth respond to aligners may be different than other club members. There may be specific clinical concerns that the doctor had in mind when prescribing your aligners. For example, your wear schedule may be 22-hours because nighttime-only wear isn&#8217;t right for your teeth.</p>
<p>Simply put, Nighttime Aligners and 22-hour wear aligners are not interchangeable.</p>
<h2>Still want a change? Ask the experts</h2>
<p>You may have heard of people who have switched from one type of aligner to the other. It&#8217;s true that in some situations, you can make the change mid-treatment. But your teeth are unique, so there&#8217;s no way to know if it&#8217;s okay for you without consulting your SmileDirectClub doctor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we make asking questions really easy. If you&#8217;re in 22-hour aligners and want to switch to Nighttime Aligners or vice versa, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out to SmileDirectClub</a> via phone, chat, email, or <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smiledirectclub-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SmileDirectClub app</a>.</p>
<p>Your treating doctor may or may not be able to help you make the switch. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that a mid-treatment change may not be possible depending on your specific circumstances. Think of all the factors that make your smile special: your age, the presence of wisdom teeth, your degree of spacing, and more. Your doctor may have prescribed your treatment plan because it is the best—or only—way to get the results you want from your aligners. But your doctor can tell you for sure and help you understand why.</p>
<p>And one big, important thing to know: If you go rogue and don&#8217;t follow your treatment plan without talking to SmileDirectClub first, you will void the Lifetime Smile Guarantee. That means no free, additional aligners if you get to the end of your treatment plan and still aren&#8217;t happy with your smile. And worst of all, diverting from the plan means you may not get the smile of your dreams.</p>
<p>So stick to the plan. Trust the teeth-aligning science behind your prescribed treatment. And talk to the doctor before making any changes. We want you to get a smile you love, and we&#8217;re here to help during every step of your Smile Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been following the news, you&#8217;ve likely heard the word &#8220;telehealth&#8221; used a lot lately. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth was becoming an important arm of medicine, but today, it&#8217;s making headlines. The social distancing recommended by the Centers for Disease Control to slow the growth of the coronavirus pandemic is <a href"https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/how-telemedicine-being-used-frontlines-coronavirus-crisis">increasing </a>the use of telehealth and telemedicine services.</p>
<p>It makes sense, right? For patients, telehealth means a doctor &#8220;visit&#8221; can happen through a phone or video call, which is ideal during these times of social distancing, says Dr. Jeffrey Sulitzer, chief clinical officer at SmileDirectClub. It can help everyone get the healthcare they need while isolating mildly ill patients from the public and putting less stress on the healthcare system.</p>
<p>But the benefits of telehealth go beyond the unique situation we find ourselves in today. The global market for telemedicine is expected to be worth <a href"https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/telemedicine-market">$130 billion by 2025</a>, according to Global Market Insights, with the United States alone accounting for half of it. While it&#8217;s too soon to tell, the pandemic might be accelerating that adoption rate — meaning it&#8217;s time to get to know telehealth and how it all works.</p>
<h3> What is telehealth? </h3>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/419020716" width="787" height="473" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Telehealth, or telemedicine, is the delivery of healthcare and healthcare-related services through remote technologies, like your smartphone or computer. Technically, telehealth refers to everything that happens remotely in the healthcare industry, and telemedicine is a subset of telehealth that focuses on direct delivery of patient care.</p>
<p>In addition to primary care, clinicians and patients can use telemedicine in dentistry and orthodontics, physical and occupational therapy, to monitor chronic diseases, and to access mental health and counseling services. That&#8217;s what we do at SmileDirectClub: we&#8217;re a teledentistry company, which is how we know the ins and outs of this new form of healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that telehealth or telemedicine does not entirely replace in-person care, but complements it, making healthcare more accessible and convenient for many.</p>
<h3> Is telehealth as effective as in-person care?</h3>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/393696992" width="640" height="640" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Telehealth has been found to effectively serve patients whose symptoms are clear and well-defined. That allows in-patient visits to focus on the more challenging cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telemedicine gives consumers the opportunity to communicate with physicians and nurse practitioners and share information without having to go into the office,&#8221; Sulitzer says. &#8220;I can use FaceTime and photos and visualize just the same information as I can from actually seeing the patient in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the case of coronavirus, telemedicine has two advantages: A potentially infected patient can avoid transmitting the virus to other vulnerable people at the doctor&#8217;s office. Second, telemedicine takes the burden off of frontline hospitals who can then focus on severely ill patients. And those advantages apply to the normal flu season, too.</p>
<p>People like the telehealth model, too. A full 83% of patients interviewed for a <a href"https://www.ajmc.com/journals/issue/2019/2019-vol25-n1/patient-and-clinician-experiences-with-telehealth-for-patient-followup-care">2018 Massachusetts General Hospital study </a> said the quality of their telehealth visits for follow-up care was just as good as or better than in-person ones. Patients also said that not having to take extended time off from work or travel to the doctor&#8217;s office were added benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telehealth gives patients some level of comfort and reassurance that they&#8217;re not alone,&#8221; Sulitzer says, &#8220;It&#8217;s also a safe environment to get the care or at least understand the next steps in what they need to do to manage the symptoms of the virus.&#8221;</p>
<h3> Telehealth&#8217;s other advantages </h3>

<p>Telehealth has its roots in providing care in underserved rural areas or remote communities that might lack access to specialty care providers.</p>
<p>SmileDirectClub&#8217;s teledentistry program has shown how it can work — at least <a href"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teleorthodontics-and-access-to-care-at-least-84-percent-of-underserved-us-counties-now-have-access-to-orthodontic-treatment-300671890.html">84% of U.S. counties</a> report increased access to teleorthodontics thanks to our presence. A <a href"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/tmj.2017.0132?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&#038;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&#038;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&#038;">2018 review</a> found that teledentistry could be comparable to face-to-face for oral screening, especially in rural areas and those with limited access to care.</p>
<p>Telehealth is also a less expensive way to monitor chronic diseases in patients or to deliver follow-up care after routine surgeries. Medical professionals can check in with patients using telehealth instead of extending hospital stays or insisting on an in-person visit that can require taking time off work and costly travel.</p>
<h3> How does telehealth work with insurance?</h3>
<p>Laws in 26 states (and counting) require that private insurance companies reimburse care providers for a telemedicine appointment just as they would for an in-house one.</p>
<p>While Medicare has traditionally dictated that such appointments would only be valid if the patient were in a designated &#8220;Health Professional Shortage Area&#8221; (HPSA) or non-metropolitan statistical area (MSA), these requirements have been waived in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always advise confirming insurance coverage for any healthcare appointment, telehealth or not,&#8221; Sulitzer says. More and more, the answers to those questions are becoming &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<h3> The future of telehealth </h3>
<p>We can all expect telehealth to become an important and common way for healthcare to happen. And the ways in which it can happen are multiplying as we speak. Smart wearables that monitor blood glucose levels or blood pressure can connect to remote healthcare networks through Wi-Fi to inform providers of any dangerous spikes.</p>
<p>Such automation and telecommunication portals make telehealth delivery more accessible, more efficient and more patient-friendly. By reducing the spread of viruses like the coronavirus, telehealth can also deliver a positive impact on public health — now and in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> offer some people the chance to straighten their teeth at night, while they sleep. Are they the right choice for you? Some people prefer to wear SmileDirectClub aligners during the day, and others choose the nighttime option.</p>
<p>Here are the basics of how the Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> work and how to decide if you might be a good candidate for using them.</p>
<h3>How Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> work</h3>
<p>Like all SmileDirectClub clear aligners, just like standard 22-hour wear aligners, Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> are custom-made with <span class="TextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-usefontface="true" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0">Comfort </span></span><span class="TextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-usefontface="true" data-contrast="none"><span class="SpellingError SCXP60472580 BCX0">Sense</span></span><span class="TextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-usefontface="true" data-contrast="none"><span class="SpellingError SpellingErrorSuperscript Superscript SCXP60472580 BCX0" data-fontsize="18"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></span><span class="EOP SCXP60472580 BCX0">​</span> technology to provide the best fit . Each treatment plan is overseen by a state licensed dentist or orthodontist, who designs an individualized schedule for every client.</p>
<p>The aligners are worn at least 10 consecutive hours per night. That&#8217;s compared to the 22 hours of our standard aligners. The tradeoff is that Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> average use time is 8-10 months vs. about 4-6 for our more round-the-clock aligners.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2605 size-full" src="https://blog.smiledirectclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCA2.jpg" alt="Wake up to straighter teeth." width="1242" height="1216" /></p>
<h3>Who can wear Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>While a shorter use time is a big benefit for many people, wearing aligners during the day doesn&#8217;t work with everyone&#8217;s lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe a patient has a business where they&#8217;re a customer service rep on the phone all day. Say they&#8217;re performers, &#8221; says Dr. Jeffery Sulitzer, SmileDirectClub&#8217;s chief medical officer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-766 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="sleep health happiness" width="474" height="316" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1.jpg 1648w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>Someone who needs to speak very clearly all day might prefer the option to straighten teeth at night. Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> also work well to help correct relatively small alignment issues, Dr. Sulitzer says, like a minor spacing correction.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t have to do a lot of pointed tooth movement, that might be a great candidate for Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Or, Dr. Sulitzer adds, Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> work well for someone who might have had braces or a retainer as a teen but is now an adult with some small regression on a tooth.</p>
<h3>Who might not choose Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>If you have significant crowding or spacing issues, the option to straighten teeth at night may not be the best fit for you. Or, if you want to finish your treatment as quickly as possible — perhaps you have a wedding or graduation coming up — you might want to opt for SmileDirectClub&#8217;s 22-hour-wear aligners.</p>
<h3>How to request Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>After this short Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> review, you might be interested in learning more. You can request them and ask any questions you may have when you complete your initial intake for SmileDirectClub services. If you have mild to moderate adjustment needs, you may be a good candidate.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a good fit, a state licensed dentist or orthodontist from SmileDirectClub&#8217;s network will create your custom clear-aligner treatment plan that you&#8217;ll be able to approve. In three to four weeks, your new aligners will arrive by mail.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How long do I need to wait after having my wisdom teeth removed before starting SmileDirectClub? Can I wear aligners if I still have my wisdom teeth? </strong></h2>
<p>We’re answering these commonly asked questions regarding wisdom teeth to help you determine if SmileDirectClub aligners are right for you. We asked the expert, our Lead Dentist, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/meet-your-dentist-smiledirectclub-q-dr-sulitzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD</a>, to get the answers.</p>
<h3><strong>How long do I need to wait after having my wisdom teeth removed before I can start with SmileDirectClub?</strong></h3>
<p>Typically, you will need to wait 6 weeks after having your third molars (or wisdom teeth) removed before starting SmileDirectClub, recommends Dr. S. If your dentist or surgeon feels it’s safe, you may be able to start earlier with a signed release form from their office.</p>
<h3><strong>Can I wear clear aligners if I still have my wisdom teeth?</strong></h3>
<p>If your dentist has recommended removal of wisdom teeth, then please follow that direction, Dr. Sulitzer says. Especially if your wisdom teeth growing in has caused your teeth to shift. If not, you can purchase our <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout">impression kit</a> or visit a <a href="http://Smiledirectclub.com/smileshops">SmileShop</a> and a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist will review your smile for you. And if it is determined that aligner treatment isn’t right for you, we will refund the cost of your impression kit. So getting started is totally risk-free.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Meet the grin gang. They’re here to make using your aligners easy. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>Get to know your SmileDirectClub Movemints, Outie tool, and more.</strong></h2>



<p>We want to make sure that your journey is as easy and comfortable as possible, so we&#8217;ve included a few extras. If any of these go missing, feel free to give us a call and we&#8217;ll be happy to replace it.</p>



<p>You should see more than just your aligners in your big blurple box, so here’s a rundown on your new best friends:</p>



<h3>SmileDirectClub clear aligner tools</h3>



<h4>Movemints</h4>



<p>When you first put in your aligners, you may notice that they are not fully seated on your teeth. Chew the Movemints and move them from one side of your teeth to the other to make sure your aligners are fully set. They&#8217;ll help your clear aligners settle in, as well as freshen your breath with a cool spearmint flavor.</p>





<h4>Outie tool</h4>



<p>Use your Outie tool to help you take your aligners out. Use one hook to pull lower aligners up and off teeth. Use the other hook to pull upper aligners down and off teeth. Never pull outward with the Outie tool – it will damage your aligners. Do not use to catch extremely tiny fish.</p>



<h4><strong>Case</strong></h4>



<p>Pretty self-explanatory. Keep your aligners in here when they aren’t in your mouth. Repeat after me: Napkins are not a case.</p>
<p><strong>Emery Board</strong></p>
<p>All of your aligners are trimmed and buffed prior to being shipped to you, but sometimes there are edges that feel sharp once they’re in your mouth. You can use this to file down those areas and make them more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Bright on + lip balm</strong></p>





<p>These aren’t tools, they’re just extras. Enjoy a 6-month supply of whitening and the best lip balm ever. You can start using the whitening at any point during your aligner journey. Be sure to read the whitening guide for the best results.</p>





<p>Once you have your aligners and get started, the next thing to do is set a reminder to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-smiledirectclub-retainers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="order your retainers (opens in a new tab)">order your retainers</a> 2–3 weeks before you’re done with treatment. All that&#8217;s left to do is start straightening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>More questions answered with everything you need to know about SmileDirectClub retainers.</strong></h2>



<p>Retainers are the most important thing for preserving your beautiful new smile. After all the hard work we’ve done together, you owe it to yourself to wear your SmileDirectClub retainers nightly to keep that gorgeous grin in place.</p>



<p>Still have questions about retainers? We’ve got answers.</p>



<h3><strong>How are retainers different from aligners?</strong></h3>



<p>SmileDirectClub retainers are made of thicker .76mm thermoplastic polyurethane and built to keep your teeth from moving back to their original position. They last up to 6 months.</p>



<h3><strong>Why can’t I just wear my last set of aligners?</strong></h3>



<p>Aligners are made using specific plastics designed to gently move teeth and are not built for long-term use. They will eventually crack.</p>



<h3><strong>Do I have to get new retainers every 6 months?</strong></h3>



<p>While you can clean them, they will still get dirty and degrade over time. Replacing them keeps the plastic strong and your smile in place since the retainers will stretch out over time.</p>



<h3><strong>Do I really have to wear retainers forever? </strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you will need to wear your retainers every night for the rest of your life – or for as long as you want your straight smile to last. But you can grin happily, knowing your teeth won’t shift back.</p>



<h3><strong>How do I clean my retainers?</strong></h3>



<p>You’ll clean your retainers the same as you did your clear aligners. Here are <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/">5 ways you can clean your aligners</a> to keep them fresh.</p>



<h3><strong>What do I do if my retainer breaks?</strong></h3>



<p>Accidents happen, grinner. Contact us and we can get another set to you.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to order your next set of clear retainers, you&#8217;ve come to the right place.</p>

<h2>Prom and graduation season is here. These pro tips will help you capture all the best moments.</h2>



<p>Prom photos and graduation pictures last a lifetime. Think about it, grinner, you&#8217;ll be showing these to your kids and grandkids one day. No pressure or anything.</p>



<p>We turned to our in-house photographer to get some expert tips for nailing your prom and graduation photos, so you can show them off with a smile for years to come. This a moment you&#8217;ll want to remember.</p>



<h3>1. Whiten your teeth the week before.</h3>



<p>The days leading up to prom or graduation are packed with appointments, assignments, and exams.

<h3>2. Find a good spot out of direct sunlight.</h3>



<p>Nothing will cast a shadow over your <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smiledirectclub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)">Instagram</a> like direct sunlight overhead. Look for a shady spot where you can snap the perfect shot for social media. You can always brighten your photo, but it’s trickier to pull out all the shadows and still maintain good photo quality.</p>



<h3>3. Play up props.</h3>



<p>If you’re not sure what to do with your hands, hold up your diploma, show off your corsage or boutonniere, or playfully grab hold of your dress or jacket and strike a pose. Interacting with some sort of prop will look the most natural and help give off confidence and excitement.</p>



<h3>4. Smile big.</h3>



<p>Congrats, grad, you did it. Show off those pearly whites with confidence, because you earned this photo op. All that&#8217;s left to do is wait for the likes to start rolling in – and maybe start packing for college.</p>



<p>Shop <strong>bright on</strong> here to get photo-ready fast.</p>

<h2><strong>Everything you need to know about how to care for clear aligners.</strong> </h2>



<p>This is it, the moment you’ve been waiting for. Your SmileDirectClub aligners are here and ready to transform your smile. Before you start your smile journey, read up on the do’s and don’ts of wearing aligners to keep your aligners – and your teeth – happy.</p>



<h3><strong>Clear aligner do’s</strong> </h3>



<ul>
<li>Protect your aligners from the sun, hot cars, and excessive heat.  </li>
<li>Wear your aligners as directed by your treating doctor.</li>
<li>Keep your aligners stored safely away from pets and children when you’re not wearing them. </li>
<li>Get regular <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dental checkups and cleanings (opens in a new tab)">dental checkups and cleanings</a> for the continued health of your teeth and gums. </li>
<li><a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Clean your aligners (opens in a new tab)">Clean your aligners</a> before putting them in each time. </li>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth before putting your aligners in. </li>
<li>Store your aligners in your case. </li>
<li>Use cold or warm water when cleaning or rinsing your aligners. </li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>Clear aligner don’ts</strong> </h3>



<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t use sharp objects to remove your aligners.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t change your wear schedule without talking to the dental team first.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wrap your aligners in a napkin or paper towel.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use hot water to clean your aligners, and don’t place them in the dishwasher. High temperatures can damage them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use denture cleaner on your aligners or soak your aligners in mouthwash, since this can damage or discolor them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wear aligners while eating or drinking anything other than cool water.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bite your aligners into position. This can damage your aligners and your teeth.</li>
</ul>



<p>Another clear aligner do: Order your retainers a few weeks before finishing treatment so you have them as soon as you need them. Smile on, grinner. </p>
