<h2><strong>More questions answered with everything you need to know about SmileDirectClub retainers.</strong></h2>



<p>Retainers are the most important thing for preserving your beautiful new smile. After all the hard work we’ve done together, you owe it to yourself to wear your SmileDirectClub retainers nightly to keep that gorgeous grin in place.</p>



<p>Still have questions about retainers? We’ve got answers.</p>



<h3><strong>How are retainers different from aligners?</strong></h3>



<p>SmileDirectClub retainers are made of thicker .76mm thermoplastic polyurethane and built to keep your teeth from moving back to their original position. They last up to 6 months.</p>



<h3><strong>Why can’t I just wear my last set of aligners?</strong></h3>



<p>Aligners are made using specific plastics designed to gently move teeth and are not built for long-term use. They will eventually crack.</p>



<h3><strong>Do I have to get new retainers every 6 months?</strong></h3>



<p>While you can clean them, they will still get dirty and degrade over time. Replacing them keeps the plastic strong and your smile in place since the retainers will stretch out over time.</p>



<h3><strong>Do I really have to wear retainers forever? </strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you will need to wear your retainers every night for the rest of your life – or for as long as you want your straight smile to last. But you can grin happily, knowing your teeth won’t shift back.</p>



<h3><strong>How do I clean my retainers?</strong></h3>



<p>You’ll clean your retainers the same as you did your clear aligners. Here are <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/">5 ways you can clean your aligners</a> to keep them fresh.</p>



<h3><strong>What do I do if my retainer breaks?</strong></h3>



<p>Accidents happen, grinner. Contact us and we can get another set to you.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to order your next set of clear retainers, you&#8217;ve come to the right place.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You've gotten the smile you love. Congratulations! Now, make sure you preserve your smile investment with a set of retainers. Our retainer subscription makes it easy!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your Smile Journey is coming to a close and we bet you&#8217;re ready to let those pearly whites shine. We must say, that smile looks good on you!</p>
<p>Your teeth have moved a lot recently and tend to want to shift back to their original position, but how can you make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen?</p>
<h2>Retainers can keep your smile in place!</h2>
<p>Just like with any orthodontic treatment, retainers are recommended to keep teeth from moving back to their starting point. Our clear retainers are designed to keep your smile from getting out of line.</p>
<p>Whereas aligners are made out of specific plastics designed to gently move teeth and are not built for long-term use, retainers are made out of thicker .76mm thermoplastic polyurethane and work to maintain your results. One set of retainers lasts up to 6 months! Replacing them keeps the plastic strong and your smile in place.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, we&#8217;ve made protecting your smile investment easy with a retainer subscription program. Simply purchase your first set and wear them as directed. Then, we&#8217;ll ship new retainers to you every 6 months. We&#8217;ve removed the hassle of remembering to order your next set and risking your teeth shifting back where they came from. Our retainer subscription makes it easy!</p>
<p>Be sure to place your retainer order about 4-5 weeks before ending treatment, so you&#8217;ll have it just in time to show off that beautiful new smile.</p>
<h2>Protecting your smile investment is easy with a retainer subscription!</h2>
<p>Ready to order retainers to keep you grinning forever and ever? Call us and we’ll take care of that for you.</p>
