										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Prom and graduation season is here. These pro tips will help you capture all the best moments.</h2>



<p>Prom photos and graduation pictures last a lifetime. Think about it, grinner, you&#8217;ll be showing these to your kids and grandkids one day. No pressure or anything.</p>



<p>We turned to our in-house photographer to get some expert tips for nailing your prom and graduation photos, so you can show them off with a smile for years to come. This a moment you&#8217;ll want to remember.</p>



<h3>1. Whiten your teeth the week before.</h3>



<p>The days leading up to prom or graduation are packed with appointments, assignments, and exams. During all that studying, you can whiten your smile easily at home with <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-to-use-bright-on-premium-teeth-whitening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bright on&#x2122; premium teeth whitening (opens in a new tab)"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening</a>. Just once in the morning and once in the evening get your teeth to their whitest white in 1 week without disrupting everyday life, so you’ll be ready for your close-up.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="788" height="525" class="wp-image-2510" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures.jpg" alt="bright on prom pictures" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bright-on-prom-pictures-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" />
<figcaption><em>Photos by </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sheriivxi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sheriza &quot;Riz&quot; Rahman  (opens in a new tab)"><em>Sheriza &#8220;Riz&#8221; Rahman </em></a></figcaption>
</figure>



<h3>2. Find a good spot out of direct sunlight.</h3>



<p>Nothing will cast a shadow over your <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smiledirectclub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram (opens in a new tab)">Instagram</a> like direct sunlight overhead. Look for a shady spot where you can snap the perfect shot for social media. You can always brighten your photo, but it’s trickier to pull out all the shadows and still maintain good photo quality.</p>



<h3>3. Play up props.</h3>



<p>If you’re not sure what to do with your hands, hold up your diploma, show off your corsage or boutonniere, or playfully grab hold of your dress or jacket and strike a pose. Interacting with some sort of prop will look the most natural and help give off confidence and excitement.</p>



<h3>4. Smile big.</h3>



<p>Congrats, grad, you did it. Show off those pearly whites with confidence, because you earned this photo op. All that&#8217;s left to do is wait for the likes to start rolling in – and maybe start packing for college.</p>



<p>Shop <strong>bright on</strong> here to get photo-ready fast.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’ve got all the answers you need about bright on teeth whitening.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>We’ve got all the answers you need about SmileDirectClub’s bright on teeth whitening.</h2>
<p>Whitening your smile has never been easier. The best part? You don’t have to pay premium prices for premium whitening. Our <strong>bright on</strong> premium teeth whitening contains our proprietary<strong> Bright Boost<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> formula, which has the same enamel-safe whitening agent used by dentists – for half the cost. And it whitens teeth in just 1 week.</p>
<p>We’re answering your most commonly asked questions here to arm you with everything you need to know to get a brighter, confident smile.</p>
<h3>How do I use bright on?</h3>
<p><a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-to-use-bright-on-premium-teeth-whitening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s everything you need to know about how to use bright on whitening</a>, plus a video to show you how.</p>
<h3>How many uses are in each bright on pen?</h3>
<p>Each <strong>bright on</strong> pen contains 4 applications.</p>
<h3>How many pens are in 1 full whitening treatment?</h3>
<p>The 4-pack of <strong>bright on </strong>is a full 1-week whitening treatment, which keeps your teeth their brightest bright for 6 months. The 8-pack of teeth whitening pens contains 2 full rounds of whitening – enough to make your deepest, darkest stains turn toward the light.</p>
<h3>When should I whiten my teeth, and how often?</h3>
<p>Whiten for 5 minutes every morning and night for 1 week. Remember to whiten every 6 months.</p>
<h3>What’s the benefit of using the light?</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll enhance the power of <strong>bright on</strong> premium whitening with the LED accelerator light, helping you achieve your pearly white grin. This LED light uses blue light to react with <strong>Bright Boost</strong>, making it absorb even faster and speed up the whitening process. Plus, the light plugs into both iPhones and Android phones, making your white smile even easier to achieve.</p>
<h3>What phones can I use the LED light with?</h3>
<p>The LED light works with a few different phone connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Micro USB</li>
<li>USB-C</li>
<li>Standard USB</li>
<li>Lightning (iPhone)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Will whitening cause tooth sensitivity?</h3>
<p><strong>bright on </strong>was specifically formulated to deliver brighter smiles to all. However, if you do feel any discomfort, discontinue use for 24 hours.</p>
<h3>Should I use bright on while wearing my invisible aligners?</h3>
<p>No, apply <strong>bright on</strong> after you’ve taken out your aligners and brushed your teeth. Great news: <strong>bright on</strong> only takes 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes in the evening – when you’re already brushing your teeth – and won’t disrupt your smile plan.</p>
<h3>Can I use bright on if I have fillings, bonding, or veneers?</h3>
<p>Using teeth whitening with bonding or fillings can discolor your teeth. <strong>bright on</strong> does not whiten veneers.</p>
<h3>Is there an age requirement for bright on?</h3>
<p>Do not use <strong>bright on</strong> if you are under 12 years old.</p>
<h3>Can I use bright on if I’m vegan?</h3>
<p>Yes! In fact, <strong>bright on</strong> is vegan, gluten-free, soy-free, and lactose-free.</p>
<h3>Can I use bright on if I’m pregnant?</h3>
<p>We recommend that women who are pregnant or nursing check with their doctor before beginning any teeth whitening treatment.</p>
<h3>What are the ingredients in bright on?</h3>
<p>Propylene glycol, hydrogen peroxide, PVP, flavor (mint).</p>
<h3>How can I buy bright on?</h3>
<p><strong>bright on </strong>is available online at <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/whitening-kit">SmileDirectClub.com, </a>on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smile-Direct-bright-Whitening-Accelerator/dp/B07GHBZ7KQ/ref=pd_sbs_194_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07GHBZ7KQ&amp;pd_rd_r=e3a5d58b-d22c-11e8-a0ff-0f3f7dc5bfcc&amp;pd_rd_w=SOn1m&amp;pd_rd_wg=tYqN7&amp;pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=7d5d9c3c-5e01-44ac-97fd-261afd40b865&amp;pf_rd_r=3N56YZJ8WA56BZ2M7GD9&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&amp;pf_rd_t=40701&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=3N56YZJ8WA56BZ2M7GD9">Amazon</a>, at Walmart, CVS, and Sam&#8217;s Club.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You don’t have to pay premium prices for premium teeth whitening.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Confidence starts with a smile, so why not make yours the best and brightest it can be? SmileDirectClub&#8217;s <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/whitening-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </strong>premium teeth whitening</a> is the fastest and easiest way to whiten your teeth — and make you feel ready to dazzle the world.</p>
<p>But pearly whites don&#8217;t always come easy&#8230;</p>
<p>You can inherit genes that make you more prone to tooth discoloration, and some of the foods and drinks you may love most can contribute to staining. Sure, there are things you can do every day to help brighten your smile: flossing, brushing, keeping up with dental cleanings — even the malic acid in strawberries can help whiten your teeth. But to take your smile to the next level of brilliance, there&#8217;s <strong>nothing like bright on teeth whitening</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8XdASWeihQ?rel=0" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2>What makes <b>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></b> so effective at teeth whitening?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of popular teeth-whitening options out there, including whitening toothpastes, rinses and dental-office whitening treatments. But unfortunately, many store-bought products contain trace amounts of the actual ingredients that whiten your teeth. And dental-office whitening requires several appointments and can be expensive.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to pay premium prices for premium teeth whitening. The bright on teeth whitening system with our unique <strong>Bright Boost<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> formula</strong> has the same enamel-safe whitening agent used by dentists — for half the cost.</p>
<p>Just five minutes in the morning and evening gets you to your brightest bright in one week without disrupting everyday life. The no-mess brush applicator keeps gel off your hands and on your teeth, and an available LED accelerator light makes the Bright Boost<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> formula work even faster.</p>

For a continuously bright smile, whiten for one week every six months.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re proud of the fact that bright on is also vegan, gluten-free and soy-free. Plus, it comes in a cool mint flavor. Here&#8217;s how to whiten your teeth with bright on — and transform your life, starting with your smile.</p>
<h2>How to whiten teeth with <b>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </b>premium teeth whitening:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Use morning and evening daily for one week.</li>
<li>Brush teeth first, but do not floss.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>bright on</strong> pen and slowly twist the bottom until gel is visible on the brush.</li>
<li>Brush the gel onto your front top and bottom teeth in a circular motion and wear for five minutes. Avoid putting gel on your gums. The gel will lightly foam as it penetrates.</li>
<li>After five minutes, spit out the excess foam. Do not rinse, eat or drink for 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Turbo-charge <b>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></b> with the LED accelerator light:</h2>
<ol>
<li>After applying the gel, plug the light into your phone using the appropriate attachment and insert the light into your mouth.</li>
<li><strong>Keep the light on for five minutes</strong>.</li>
<li>After five minutes, remove the light and unplug it from your phone. Spit out excess foam if needed.</li>
<li>Using lukewarm water, rinse and wipe off the mouthpiece. Allow the light to dry in a well-ventilated place.</li>
<li>Once the light is dry, pack it into its plastic case. Because the case has limited space, we suggest removing the detachable Android and iPhone cables from the LED light to avoid damaging them.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips for <b>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></b> teeth whitening:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not rinse, eat or drink <strong>for 20 minutes</strong> after you&#8217;re done.</li>
<li>Avoid staining foods and drinks, such as coffee, chocolate or red wine for 24 hours.</li>
<li>The LED accelerator light and cables are waterproof; however, the USB Android and iPhone adapters are not. Do not let the adapters get wet. If they do get wet, dry them off immediately.</li>
<li>Remember to whiten for one week every six months.</li>

<h3><strong>3. Help whiten your teeth.</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Teeth whitening tips for drinking wine and keeping your smile bright.</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t let red wine dim your smile. Here are a few ways you can raise a glass without having to worry about the health and discoloration of your tooth enamel (you know: the white part). Cheers.</p>
<h3>1. Drink white, not red.</h3>
<p>This is the most obvious tip. If red wine stains your dark clothes, it can definitely stain your white teeth. Instead of a glass of Pinot Noir, opt for a Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. There are tons of different options from which you can choose, and you’ll be able to enjoy your vino without worrying about teeth discoloration.</p>
<h3>2. Brush after each glass – and before.</h3>
<p>Wine actually clings to plaque, not your teeth. Brushing plaque away decreases the chance of damage from the acid and sugars that contribute to a wine-stained smile.</p>
<h3>3. Sip on sparkling water.</h3>
<p>Sipping on sparkling water between glasses of wine will help scrub away any temporary stains that have the potential to become permanent ones. This is because of the bubbles in the water that help break up the stains. The water prevents not only discoloration but also dehydration. Read: hangovers.</p>
<h3>4. Eat cheese.</h3>
<p>Cheese and wine? Groundbreaking. But there&#8217;s a reason why cheese and wine make a dynamic duo. Because our mouths are naturally acidic, we need to eat something basic (with a higher pH value) before drinking acidic fruit juice – fermented or not. Enter cheese. The basic pH value of cheese is thought to protect your teeth for up to 30 minutes while you sip on wine. It’s a match made in heaven.</p>
<h3>5. Use teeth whitening gel.</h3>
<p>Even when you’re not drinking wine, teeth whitening gel is a beauty routine staple. Use our <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-to-use-bright-on-premium-teeth-whitening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening</a> for just 1 week and the results last up to 6 months. Keeping up on your teeth whitening routine is a good way to stay ahead of those wine (and coffee and soda) stains.</p>
<p>Get bright on today to keep your smile nice and bright. That&#8217;s something to cheers to.</p>
