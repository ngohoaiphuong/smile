										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve tried everything possible to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">make your aligners more comfortable</a>, but there is one spot that is still bothering you. So, you decide to give SmileDirectClub a call and our dental team suggests that you trim and file the area. But, how do you even do that?</p>
<p>Watch SmileDirectClub&#8217;s Dr. Riddhi walk you through the process below.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOd1jpbCoGc" width="840" height="472.5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></p>
<p>If the dental team advises you to trim and file your aligners, Dr. Riddhi suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use cuticle scissors, so you can make the smallest trim possible.</li>
<li>Trim as per the directions of the dental team, you can request a video call with them to walk you through it.</li>
<li>Once trimmed, use your emery board to file that area. Remember to buff in the same direction to reduce rough edges!</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: you can always take off, but you can&#8217;t put any back! So, take it slow while trimming.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Don’t make these common mistakes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Don’t make these common mistakes taking your at-home dental impressions with the SmileDirectClub impression kit.</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve already talked through <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-make-good-first-impression">how to take good-quality dental impressions at home</a>, but it’s just as important to know what not to do.</p>
<p>Making your impressions is the first step on your <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit/">journey to a smile you’ll love</a>. Since good impressions ensure accurate aligners, and accurate aligners mean happier smiles, we’re here to help make sure you get it right. (But mistakes happen, grinner, which is why we include an extra set that you can use to be more accurate and fix any issues.)</p>
<p>These are the most common mistakes people make while taking their impressions with the SmileDirectClub impression kit and how to fix them.</p>
<h3><strong>1. No gumline present</strong></h3>
<p>Each impression must fully capture both your teeth and gums. Use your fingers to firmly and evenly press the tray onto your teeth. Stop once your teeth lightly hit the tray.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2448" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-No-Gumline.jpg" alt="bad-dental-impression-No-Gumline" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-No-Gumline.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-No-Gumline-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-No-Gumline-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><strong>2. Improper putty mixture</strong></h3>
<p>The gray and purple putties must be fully mixed until they are one solid color; otherwise, the mixture will not set properly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2449" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-improper-Mixture.jpg" alt="bad-dental-impression-improper-Mixture" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-improper-Mixture.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-improper-Mixture-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-improper-Mixture-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><strong>3. Double impression</strong></h3>
<p>Use your thumbs to gently hold the tray in place and ensure that it does not move while you make your impression.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2450" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-denta-impressionDouble-Impression.jpg" alt="bad-dental-impression-Double-Impression" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-denta-impressionDouble-Impression.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-denta-impressionDouble-Impression-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-denta-impressionDouble-Impression-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><strong>4. Uneven pressure</strong></h3>
<p>Use your thumbs to gently push the tray and apply even pressure to both sides. Hold the tray in place to ensure that it does not move while making your impression.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2451" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-Uneven-Pressure.jpg" alt="bad-dental-impression-Uneven-Pressure" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-Uneven-Pressure.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-Uneven-Pressure-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bad-dental-impression-Uneven-Pressure-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>Don’t worry about making a bad impression. It could be the worst impression ever created on this green Earth, and we’d still want it. Send all 4 impressions back. Remember, we don’t judge – we grin.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our redesigned big blurple box of invisible aligners will make your smile journey easier than ever.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>SmileDirectClub’s clear aligners box has everything you need to get a smile you’ll love.</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Club. We’re so excited to help you get that straight smile of your dreams.</p>
<p>First things first. See that sticker on the front of your open box? It’s reusable, to keep your aligners stored nice and neat inside the box throughout your smile plan. No peeking. <strong>Don’t pull out all your aligners, just your next set</strong>. We’ve organized everything for you, and we’ve already verified that your aligners are correct.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see what’s inside this beautiful blurple box.</p>
<h3>1. Aligners</h3>
<p>Your entire treatment’s worth of aligners will be shipped in this box. Your first set of aligners will be labeled, along with each subsequent set. Grab that first pack and double-check to make sure it’s the right one. But remember, don’t pull out all your aligners. We’ve kept this box nice and organized for you.</p>
<h3>2. Aligner case</h3>
<p>This handy case stores and protects your aligners from puppies and other seek-and-destroy monsters. Always store your aligners in this case whenever you take them out to eat or drink anything other than cool water. You can even invest in a <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/tile-case">Trackable case powered by by Tile<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, so you never lose your aligners.</p>
<h3>3. bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> premium teeth whitening</h3>
<p>We also include 4 bright on premium teeth whitening pens as an added bonus. The bright on guide is included so you know exactly how to use it.</p>
<h3>4. Lip balm</h3>
<p>You’ll love our favorite moisturizing vanilla lip balm. Trust us, <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/lip-balm">you’re going to want more</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Smile Stretcher</h3>
<p>Use this to take photos for your virtual check-ins with your doctor.</p>
<h3>6. Aligner tools</h3>
<p>Plenty of <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/meet-your-smiledirectclub-clear-aligner-tools/">tools are included</a> to help make your journey as smooth as possible. Your outie tool will help you remove your aligners. And your Movemints help seat your aligners in place. The emery board included will help smooth out any rough edges.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Go online right away for your first check-in at <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/login/">SmileDirectClub.com/checkin</a> or download our app, so we’ll be able to remind you when to change to your next aligners. We’ll also be able to remind you about virtual check-ins with your doctor.</p>
<p>When you finish your smile plan in a few months, don’t add the box to a landfill. Take out that white drawer where your aligners were and flip it around. Now you’ve got a nifty thing to hold stuff that makes you smile.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Check out our traveling SmileBus for the mobile SmileShop experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>We&#8217;re straightening teeth for up to 60% less than traditional braces in your neighborhood.</h2>
<p>We have <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileShops</a> across the country, with new locations opening every week. You can also visit our traveling SmileBus for the mobile SmileShop experience. You&#8217;ll be able to talk to members of our team, getting up close and personal with SmileDirectClub. You’ll get a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-scan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D image of your mouth</a> that will then be used to create custom invisible aligners to straighten your teeth.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s a 3D image?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1945" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus.jpg" alt="smile direct club smile bus scan" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;re bringing the SmileShop experience to you with our pop-up SmileBus. Your SmileBus 3D image with one of our experienced SmileGuides only takes 30 minutes, and for a limited time, it&#8217;s also free. We&#8217;ll even send you home with some <strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening so you can jump-start your new smile.</p>
<p>The SmileGuide will use a handheld 3D camera that takes 6000 photos per second to create a digital map of your smile. They’ll glide the camera over your teeth to make sure they capture every part of your smile. You can actually see the shape of each of your teeth on the screen beside you as they’re being recorded.</p>
<h2>What happens after the 3D scan?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1944" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus-scan.jpg" alt="smile direct club bus smile guides" width="788" height="526" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus-scan.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus-scan-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Smile-Direct-Club-Smile-Bus-scan-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<p>Your image results are sent to a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist in our network who will evaluate your smile remotely. Within 72 hours, the doctor overseeing you will then review and approve your personal smile plan, which will show you how your teeth will shift month by month. You’ll see the length of your smile plan, your personal wear schedule, and how your smile will look at the end of your new smile journey.</p>
<p>After you purchase your aligners, you&#8217;ll receive every set of aligners shipped right to your doorstep. Wear your aligners all day and night except when eating and drinking anything other than water. And don&#8217;t forget to keep using your <strong>bright on</strong>. You&#8217;ll be on your way to a straighter, brighter smile before you know it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Get someone you love started on a smile they’ll love.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>This holiday season, make someone smile by gifting them a grin that they’ll love for years to come.</strong></h2>
<p>This year, give a gift that means more: the gift of a smile and a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/how-i-overcame-my-lifelong-confidence-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lifetime of confidence</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve recently completed your own smile journey, pass on the gift of grin to someone you love most, whether it’s your son or daughter, mom or dad, sibling, or significant other. At SmileDirectClub, we’re all about sharing the smiles, and we want you to do the same.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can get someone you love started on a smile they’ll love. Here are a few ideas to help you give the gift of confidence.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Gift of a Smile gift card</strong></h3>
<p>This is the greatest gift of all you can give someone who’s dreaming of transforming their smile. Our full pay gift card covers your friend or family member’s entire aligner treatment, plus their SmileShop visit or impression kit and a bonus 4-pack of our <strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening. What you&#8217;ll love is you can either pay everything up front or choose convenient monthly payments to make their smile dream a reality.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Get started gift card</strong></h3>
<p>If covering someone’s entire smile journey isn’t in the budget this year, choose a get started gift card to start their smile journey. The balance can be applied toward a SmileShop visit, an impression kit, and aligners. Pick what works best for you. It’s that easy.</p>

<h3><strong>4. SmileDirectClub impression kit </strong></h3>
<p>An <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impression kit</a> is the perfect gift to give, no matter the occasion. It’s something they can open and get started on right away. Time it to a holiday playlist, and they’ll be on their way to a shiny new smile in just 30 minutes. Our impression kits include purple and gray putty, 4 impression trays, a Smile Stretcher for photos, and nitrile gloves to keep it clean. All they’ll have to do is make their impressions, snap a few photos, and send the kit back to us in the mail using the prepaid shipping label. Their new smile awaits.</p>

<h3><strong>5. SmileDirectClub bright on whitening kit</strong></h3>
<p>For some people on your list, a new smile might not (yet) mean a straighter smile, but a whiter smile. Our <strong>bright on</strong> premium teeth whitening can help with that. It’s 3x faster to use than strips and uses the same enamel-safe whitening agent used by dentists for a fraction of the cost. It’ll be the brightest gift under the tree, we promise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Her twin sister wore traditional metal braces, while Ashlyn got a smile she loves with invisible aligners. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>While her twin sister wore braces, Ashlyn got a smile she loves with aligners.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h2>
<p>Keesha was looking for fun ideas on Pinterest one day when she came across SmileDirectClub. She was instantly intrigued.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>The mom of 3 girls took her then-12-year-old twin daughters for a consultation at their local <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-do-doctors-really-think-about-invisible-aligners-for-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orthodontist</a>. Ashlyn had some front crowding, which would require a short treatment plan. She didn&#8217;t have any bite issues, and she wouldn&#8217;t need to wear rubber bands with braces. Yet her treatment plan was going to cost just as much as her twin sister&#8217;s 2-year stint with braces: US$6,180.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Keesha remembered that SmileDirectClub is completely doctor-directed and up to 60% less than traditional braces (yes, 60%), so after that orthodontist appointment, she decided to take Ashlyn to a SmileShop instead.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Ashlyn completed her smile plan last November, and today she&#8217;s proud to show off her beautiful new grin. We chatted with Ashlyn and her mom to get the scoop on her SmileDirectClub experience.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1991" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces.jpg" alt="" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashlyn-teen-before-braces-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><b>Thanks for sharing you</b><b>r SmileDirectClub review with us! </b><b>K</b><b>eesha, h</b><b>ow </b><b>did you choose SmileDirectClub for Ashlyn but braces for her twin sister?</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Keesha, mom: </b>I sought quotes for traditional braces and aligners at an orthodontist&#8217;s office for both of my daughters. Addison needed more extensive treatment, and traditional braces were a better plan for her. She needed bite correction and would have to wear rubber bands.  <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>Ashlyn had a simpler plan, requiring a shorter treatment time, yet was quoted the same price for treatment as her sister. After her appointment I called SmileDirectClub and scheduled a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smile-direct-club-3d-scan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free in-person </a>visit at the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago SmileShop</a>. It was an almost 3-hour drive, but if she was a candidate for SDC, it would definitely be worth the day trip to save money. Within 24 hours we had her projected smile plan! We were thrilled – it matched what we were shown during our visit to our local orthodontist office!  <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b>Ashlyn, daughter: </b>My mom took me to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg2-M_vNr30&amp;t=27s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileShop</a>. The shop was really cool, and the woman who scanned my teeth was great about explaining what she was doing. I got to watch the 3D rendering of my teeth on the screen. I left with some cool free SDC stuff, too!<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1990" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club.jpg" alt="" width="788" height="525" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club.jpg 788w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/teen-mom-smile-direct-club-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /></p>
<h3><b>Walk us through what your experience was like.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Ashlyn:</b> I didn&#8217;t feel or look different while wearing my aligners. The first few hours after putting in a new set of aligners, my teeth were a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/do-invisible-aligners-hurt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little sore</a>, but after that I practically forgot I was even wearing them.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>No one even knew I had the aligners in!<b><i> </i></b>Only those who saw me taking them out knew I was wearing them. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><b>Keesha: </b>Ashlyn was told what would be expected of her and that the results were dependent on her following the plan and wearing the aligners as required. She totally complied with her plan.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<p>I think getting a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D image of your teeth</a> is a great option. Every set of Ashlyn&#8217;s aligners snapped into place with no need for dental wax and no cut-up gums. I&#8217;m pretty sure no one ever noticed her wearing the aligners either. They fit so well, and she never had issues with speaking. She was great about brushing after lunch at school and carried disposable toothbrushes with her in case she needed one when we were out. Ashlyn has been in her retainers for a few months now, and she has a beautiful smile!<b> </b>Seeing her smile full of confidence is all I as a parent can ask for. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<h3><b>Ashlyn, what was it like wearing clear aligners while your twin sister wore braces? </b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Ashlyn: </b>Haha! Every 4 to 6 weeks, she goes in to have her braces adjusted, while I would just pop in a new set of aligners every 2 weeks. I started my 7-month smile plan after her and have completed my treatment. She doesn&#8217;t even know when she&#8217;ll get hers off.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Did wearing your aligners affect your daily activities at all? </b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Ashlyn: </b>No! I play volleyball and sing in choir at school. Wearing my aligners didn&#8217;t interfere with my activities at all. Even wearing them while giving presentations in class didn&#8217;t cause any issues. <span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
<h3><b>Keesha, as a mom, w</b><b>ould you recommend SmileDirectClub to other parents and teens? </b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></h3>
<p><b>Keesha: </b><a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-things-parents-know-teen-braces-smile-direct-club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Absolutely</a>! If parents find their child is a candidate for SDC, it is a great, affordable option to traditional braces. As parents, any way we can make our money stretch farther is great!<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><b>Ashlyn: </b>It was a quick and simple process.

					<description><![CDATA[One of the best (and most unique!) parts about SmileDirectClub is that you can get started with a free, 3D scan. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>One of the best parts about SmileDirectClub is that you can get started with a 3D image.</h2>
<p>The 3D image of your mouth is an easy and convenient alternative to an impression kit. Instead of taking your own photos and impressions, a SmileGuide captures a 3D image of your smile. That image will then be used to create your custom invisible aligners to straighten your teeth.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227910945" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>How does the 3D image work?</h3>
<p>Head to your<a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> local SmileShop</a> for an easy, 30-minute appointment with one of our experienced SmileGuides.</p>
<p>The SmileGuide will use a handheld 3D camera that takes 6,000 photos per second (yep, per second) to create a digital map of your smile. They&#8217;ll glide the camera over your teeth to make sure they capture every part of your smile. Once your appointment is complete, it&#8217;s sent to a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">state-licensed dentist or orthodontist</a> in our network who will evaluate your smile. The doctor overseeing your case will then create your personal treatment plan, which will show you how your new smile will look.</p>
<h3>Who are the SmileGuides?</h3>
<p>Our SmileGuides come from a variety of backgrounds and are trained to efficiently and accurately capture a 3D image of your smile. Many of our SmileGuides are registered dental assistants or dental hygienists. We actively monitor and evaluate the quality of their work, including your experience. Our SmileGuides are able to answer any questions you have about our service, our process, and our technology, as well as most questions about straightening your smile using invisible aligners.</p>
<h3>What happens after my appointment?</h3>
<p>Your 3D image is the beginning of your journey toward your new grin. The smile you&#8217;ll love is only a few steps away. Learn more about what happens after your SmileShop visit in <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Where is the closest SmileShop?</h3>
<p>We have many SmileShops across the country. You can find the full list of locations <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/smileshops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Here's what to expect as you begin your journey toward your beautiful new grin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You recently completed your 3D image at a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/locations/">SmileShop</a>, or you mailed back your <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout">impression kit</a> to us. Now you’re probably wondering, <em>what&#8217;s next?</em> That straight smile you&#8217;ve always dreamed of is only a few steps away! Here&#8217;s what to expect as you begin your journey toward your beautiful new grin.</p>
<h2><strong>1. We build a 3D model of your teeth.</strong></h2>
<p>One of our state-licensed dental professionals uses the impressions of your mouth or the 3D image from your SmileShop visit to see exactly what&#8217;s going on. We build an individualized smile plan to straighten your teeth, month by month, moving each tooth like a puzzle.</p>
<h2><strong>2. We&#8217;ll share a preview of your new smile.</strong></h2>
<p>Within about 72 hours of receiving your impressions or image, we&#8217;ll send you a preview of your treatment plan showing how your teeth will transform. Log in to your SmileDirectClub account or download our app to look at your 3D plan. You can even move the image and check out each angle of your new smile!</p>
<h2><strong>3. We ship your aligners directly to you.</strong></h2>
<p>Your aligners are as unique to you as a fingerprint. We ship all your aligner at once directly to you, eliminating the need for costly in-office visits. Since you have your entire treatment&#8217;s aligners, you don&#8217;t need to worry if you move or travel in the midst of your plan. Plus, we&#8217;ll send our <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/collections/teeth-whitening"><strong>bright on<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong> premium teeth whitening</a> so you can show off those pearly whites.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Wear your aligners all day and night, except for eating and drinking.</strong></h2>
<p>Wear your aligners as prescribed all day and night (or 10 consecutive hours for Nighttime Aligners). Remove them when eating and drinking anything except water. Use your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/movemints">Movemints</a> to ensure your aligners are the <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable">most comfortable fit</a>. We also suggest <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/">cleaning aligners regularly</a> with soap and water to keep them fresh.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Your doctor or orthodontist will schedule regular virtual check-ins.</strong></h2>
<p>Remote doesn’t mean you&#8217;re alone. Our Customer Care and Dental teams are available 24/7 via phone, chat, email, video chat, and social media. And your state-licensed dentist or orthodontist will guide you each step of the way. These check-ins help monitor your progress and keep everything moving according to plan.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Enjoy your new smile!</strong></h2>
<p>Once you complete your plan, smile! Enjoy that grin. Feel free to order touch-up whitening at any time through your account. And don&#8217;t forget to purchase your retainers to keep your straight smile in place.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Do your aligners sometimes feel a little strange? Here are 5 easy tips for making your invisible aligners more comfortable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re experiencing discomfort after putting in your new aligners, don’t worry. It’s a natural first step in your journey to unlocking the power of your smile. Some Club members may not experience any discomfort, but we have some tips for those of you who do.</p>
<p>Here are a few easy <strong>tips for making your aligners more comfortable</strong>.</p>
<h2>1. Switch your aligners at night</h2>
<p>You’ll have the whole night to get used to the feel of your aligners and will probably sleep through most of the discomfort. If you’re using SmileDirectClub Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, you’re one step ahead of the game here.</p>
<h2>2. Use your Movemints.</h2>
<p>Included in your aligners box, <strong>Movemints are mints</strong> designed to help your aligners sit better.</p>
<p>They help seat your aligners and make them more comfortable in your mouth, especially if you&#8217;re having trouble getting the aligners to snap in all the way or if there&#8217;s a little extra space between your teeth and the aligners.</p>
<p>Put them in your mouth and chew on them several times a day until your aligners fit better. They&#8217;ll also provide an extra minty flavor while seating your aligners.</p>
<h2>3. Use the emery board, if needed.</h2>
<p>If you need to do any fine-tuning on the shape of your aligners, the emery board in your aligner box will be your friend. You can use it to lightly file down any sharp or rough edges on your aligners. If there’s any excess material on your aligners, just use small scissors to cut it off, and then use an emery board to file the new edge.</p>
<h2>4. Use dental wax to cushion sore areas.</h2>
<p>You can put a small wad of dental wax between your aligners and your teeth in any areas that feel particularly sore. The wax will help cushion your teeth as you get used to your aligners. We recommend applying the wax to dry aligners to ensure that it stays in place.</p>
<h2>5. Eat cold, soothing foods.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2761 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/popsicle.png" alt="raspberry popsicle" width="417" height="320" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/popsicle.png 750w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/popsicle-300x230.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /></p>
<p>Cold popsicles, smoothies and frozen fruit are all delicious snacks, but their cool temperatures can also help to soothe a sore mouth. Give it a try — but don&#8217;t forget that you have to remove your aligners before eating or drinking anything other than cool water.</p>
<p>If you want some prolonged cooling relief but don&#8217;t feel like eating anything, <strong>applying an ice pack to the outside of your mouth</strong> can have a similar effect.</p>
<p>You may also consider<strong> taking some Tylenol, Advil, or Aleve</strong> for two to three days to help ease any pain.</p>
<h3>Bonus tip: Hang in there.</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, keep wearing your aligners. If you stop for a day or two, it&#8217;ll become harder to put them back in, which could make the discomfort last longer than it would otherwise.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried a few remedies and you&#8217;re still feeling discomfort, or if you&#8217;re experiencing significant pain, call our Customer Care team right away. They can provide additional tips specific to your treatment plan to make your teeth aligners easier to wear.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget that despite some temporary discomfort, the outcome of your smile journey will be worth it.</p>
