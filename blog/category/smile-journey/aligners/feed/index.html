										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>You&#8217;ve begun your Smile Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.  After wearing your aligners every day for weeks, you can already see a dramatic change in your teeth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re thrilled.</p>
<p>A friend of yours has made great progress with their aligners, too, and they&#8217;re only wearing them at night. That sounds like something you&#8217;d like to try—having to take them out every time you eat is getting a little inconvenient. And if it&#8217;s working for your friend, why not for you, right?</p>
<p>Hold up! Your treatment plan is customized, specific, and extremely important to follow to the letter. The same goes for if you&#8217;re wearing <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/introducing-nighttime-aligners-only-from-smile-direct-club/">Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> and want to try wearing them all day to move things along. Using your 22-hour SmileDirectClub Aligners as Nighttime Aligners or vice versa could slow your progress toward the smile of your dreams—not speed it up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<h2>Moving teeth is serious science</h2>
<p>The science of moving teeth isn&#8217;t as simple as it might seem.</p>
<p>See, Nighttime Aligners and standard SmileDirectClub Aligners are different. Sure, they may look alike. But each type of aligner is a highly specialized device designed to make precise adjustments to tooth position.</p>
<p>Nighttime Aligners are designed to move crooked teeth into a perfect smile in an average of 8-10 months and require at least 10 hours per day of continuous wear at night. SmileDirectClub Aligners are designed to move teeth in 4-6 months and require 22 hours of wear per day.</p>
<p>Your assigned doctor is a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist who was assigned to you to manage your specific alignment needs. They&#8217;ve used their expertise to create <em>your</em> treatment plan for <em>your</em> teeth. They&#8217;ve calculated exactly how much pressure the aligners will apply to each tooth and for how long. And the amount of time your aligner is out of your mouth is a part of the equation, too. Diverging from your treatment plan can disrupt that careful calculation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3147" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1.jpeg" alt="SmileDirectClub doctor" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1.jpeg 1920w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dr.-Moore-1-1536x864.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>And keep in mind, your smile is unique. The way your teeth respond to aligners may be different than other club members. There may be specific clinical concerns that the doctor had in mind when prescribing your aligners. For example, your wear schedule may be 22-hours because nighttime-only wear isn&#8217;t right for your teeth.</p>
<p>Simply put, Nighttime Aligners and 22-hour wear aligners are not interchangeable.</p>
<h2>Still want a change? Ask the experts</h2>
<p>You may have heard of people who have switched from one type of aligner to the other. It&#8217;s true that in some situations, you can make the change mid-treatment. But your teeth are unique, so there&#8217;s no way to know if it&#8217;s okay for you without consulting your SmileDirectClub doctor.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we make asking questions really easy. If you&#8217;re in 22-hour aligners and want to switch to Nighttime Aligners or vice versa, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out to SmileDirectClub</a> via phone, chat, email, or <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/smiledirectclub-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SmileDirectClub app</a>.</p>
<p>Your treating doctor may or may not be able to help you make the switch. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that a mid-treatment change may not be possible depending on your specific circumstances. Think of all the factors that make your smile special: your age, the presence of wisdom teeth, your degree of spacing, and more. Your doctor may have prescribed your treatment plan because it is the best—or only—way to get the results you want from your aligners. But your doctor can tell you for sure and help you understand why.</p>
<p>And one big, important thing to know: If you go rogue and don&#8217;t follow your treatment plan without talking to SmileDirectClub first, you will void the Lifetime Smile Guarantee. That means no free, additional aligners if you get to the end of your treatment plan and still aren&#8217;t happy with your smile. And worst of all, diverting from the plan means you may not get the smile of your dreams.</p>
<p>So stick to the plan. Trust the teeth-aligning science behind your prescribed treatment. And talk to the doctor before making any changes. We want you to get a smile you love, and we&#8217;re here to help during every step of your Smile Journey <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="js-story-text js-commentable">
<p>Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> offer some people the chance to straighten their teeth at night, while they sleep. Are they the right choice for you? Some people prefer to wear SmileDirectClub aligners during the day, and others choose the nighttime option.</p>
<p>Here are the basics of how the Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> work and how to decide if you might be a good candidate for using them.</p>
<h3>How Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> work</h3>
<p>Like all SmileDirectClub clear aligners, just like standard 22-hour wear aligners, Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> are custom-made with <span class="TextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-usefontface="true" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0">Comfort </span></span><span class="TextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-usefontface="true" data-contrast="none"><span class="SpellingError SCXP60472580 BCX0">Sense</span></span><span class="TextRun SCXP60472580 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-usefontface="true" data-contrast="none"><span class="SpellingError SpellingErrorSuperscript Superscript SCXP60472580 BCX0" data-fontsize="18"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></span><span class="EOP SCXP60472580 BCX0">​</span> technology to provide the best fit . Each treatment plan is overseen by a state licensed dentist or orthodontist, who designs an individualized schedule for every client.</p>
<p>The aligners are worn at least 10 consecutive hours per night. That&#8217;s compared to the 22 hours of our standard aligners. The tradeoff is that Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> average use time is 8-10 months vs. about 4-6 for our more round-the-clock aligners.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2605 size-full" src="https://blog.smiledirectclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NCA2.jpg" alt="Wake up to straighter teeth." width="1242" height="1216" /></p>
<h3>Who can wear Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>While a shorter use time is a big benefit for many people, wearing aligners during the day doesn&#8217;t work with everyone&#8217;s lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe a patient has a business where they&#8217;re a customer service rep on the phone all day. Say they&#8217;re performers, &#8221; says Dr. Jeffery Sulitzer, SmileDirectClub&#8217;s chief medical officer.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-766 alignright" src="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="sleep health happiness" width="474" height="316" srcset="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sleep-health-happiness-1.jpg 1648w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>Someone who needs to speak very clearly all day might prefer the option to straighten teeth at night. Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> also work well to help correct relatively small alignment issues, Dr. Sulitzer says, like a minor spacing correction.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t have to do a lot of pointed tooth movement, that might be a great candidate for Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Or, Dr. Sulitzer adds, Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> work well for someone who might have had braces or a retainer as a teen but is now an adult with some small regression on a tooth.</p>
<h3>Who might not choose Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>If you have significant crowding or spacing issues, the option to straighten teeth at night may not be the best fit for you. Or, if you want to finish your treatment as quickly as possible — perhaps you have a wedding or graduation coming up — you might want to opt for SmileDirectClub&#8217;s 22-hour-wear aligners.</p>
<h3>How to request Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>
<p>After this short Nighttime Aligners<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> review, you might be interested in learning more. You can request them and ask any questions you may have when you complete your initial intake for SmileDirectClub services. If you have mild to moderate adjustment needs, you may be a good candidate.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a good fit, a state licensed dentist or orthodontist from SmileDirectClub&#8217;s network will create your custom clear-aligner treatment plan that you&#8217;ll be able to approve. In three to four weeks, your new aligners will arrive by mail.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How long do I need to wait after having my wisdom teeth removed before starting SmileDirectClub? Can I wear aligners if I still have my wisdom teeth? </strong></h2>
<p>We’re answering these commonly asked questions regarding wisdom teeth to help you determine if SmileDirectClub aligners are right for you. We asked the expert, our Lead Dentist, <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/meet-your-dentist-smiledirectclub-q-dr-sulitzer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD</a>, to get the answers.</p>
<h3><strong>How long do I need to wait after having my wisdom teeth removed before I can start with SmileDirectClub?</strong></h3>
<p>Typically, you will need to wait 6 weeks after having your third molars (or wisdom teeth) removed before starting SmileDirectClub, recommends Dr. S. If your dentist or surgeon feels it’s safe, you may be able to start earlier with a signed release form from their office.</p>
<h3><strong>Can I wear clear aligners if I still have my wisdom teeth?</strong></h3>
<p>If your dentist has recommended removal of wisdom teeth, then please follow that direction, Dr. Sulitzer says. Especially if your wisdom teeth growing in has caused your teeth to shift. If not, you can purchase our <a href="http://smiledirectclub.com/checkout">impression kit</a> or visit a <a href="http://Smiledirectclub.com/smileshops">SmileShop</a> and a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist will review your smile for you. And if it is determined that aligner treatment isn’t right for you, we will refund the cost of your impression kit. So getting started is totally risk-free.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Meet the grin gang. They’re here to make using your aligners easy. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>Get to know your SmileDirectClub Movemints, Outie tool, and more.</strong></h2>



<p>We want to make sure that your journey is as easy and comfortable as possible, so we&#8217;ve included a few extras. If any of these go missing, feel free to give us a call and we&#8217;ll be happy to replace it.</p>



<p>You should see more than just your aligners in your big blurple box, so here’s a rundown on your new best friends:</p>



<h3>SmileDirectClub clear aligner tools</h3>



<h4>Movemints</h4>



<p>When you first put in your aligners, you may notice that they are not fully seated on your teeth. Chew the Movemints and move them from one side of your teeth to the other to make sure your aligners are fully set. They&#8217;ll help your clear aligners settle in, as well as freshen your breath with a cool spearmint flavor.</p>





<h4>Outie tool</h4>



<p>Use your Outie tool to help you take your aligners out. Use one hook to pull lower aligners up and off teeth. Use the other hook to pull upper aligners down and off teeth. Never pull outward with the Outie tool – it will damage your aligners. Do not use to catch extremely tiny fish.</p>



<h4><strong>Case</strong></h4>



<p>Pretty self-explanatory. Keep your aligners in here when they aren’t in your mouth. Repeat after me: Napkins are not a case.</p>
<p><strong>Emery Board</strong></p>
<p>All of your aligners are trimmed and buffed prior to being shipped to you, but sometimes there are edges that feel sharp once they’re in your mouth. You can use this to file down those areas and make them more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Bright on + lip balm</strong></p>





<p>These aren’t tools, they’re just extras. Enjoy a 6-month supply of whitening and the best lip balm ever. You can start using the whitening at any point during your aligner journey. Be sure to read the whitening guide for the best results.</p>





<p>Once you have your aligners and get started, the next thing to do is set a reminder to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-smiledirectclub-retainers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="order your retainers (opens in a new tab)">order your retainers</a> 2–3 weeks before you’re done with treatment. All that&#8217;s left to do is start straightening.</p>



	<p style="text-align: center">
		<a href="https://www.pages03.net/smiledirectclub/retainers" class="btn btn--purple">
			Order Retainers		</a>
	</p>

<h2><strong>Everything you need to know about how to care for clear aligners.</strong> </h2>



<p>This is it, the moment you’ve been waiting for. Your SmileDirectClub aligners are here and ready to transform your smile. Before you start your smile journey, read up on the do’s and don’ts of wearing aligners to keep your aligners – and your teeth – happy.</p>



<h3><strong>Clear aligner do’s</strong> </h3>



<ul>
<li>Protect your aligners from the sun, hot cars, and excessive heat.  </li>
<li>Wear your aligners as directed by your treating doctor.</li>
<li>Keep your aligners stored safely away from pets and children when you’re not wearing them. </li>
<li>Get regular <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="dental checkups and cleanings (opens in a new tab)">dental checkups and cleanings</a> for the continued health of your teeth and gums. </li>
<li><a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Clean your aligners (opens in a new tab)">Clean your aligners</a> before putting them in each time. </li>
<li>Brush and floss your teeth before putting your aligners in. </li>
<li>Store your aligners in your case. </li>
<li>Use cold or warm water when cleaning or rinsing your aligners. </li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>Clear aligner don’ts</strong> </h3>



<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t use sharp objects to remove your aligners.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t change your wear schedule without talking to the dental team first.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wrap your aligners in a napkin or paper towel.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use hot water to clean your aligners, and don’t place them in the dishwasher. High temperatures can damage them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use denture cleaner on your aligners or soak your aligners in mouthwash, since this can damage or discolor them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wear aligners while eating or drinking anything other than cool water.</li>

</ul>



<p>Another clear aligner do: Order your retainers a few weeks before finishing treatment so you have them as soon as you need them. Smile on, grinner. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Will teeth grinding or clenching my teeth interfere with invisible aligners? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Will teeth grinding or clenching my teeth interfere with aligners?</h2>
<p>We’re answering this commonly asked question to help you determine if SmileDirectClub aligners are right for you. Can I wear <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/what-are-invisible-aligners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aligners</a> if I grind or clench my teeth? We went straight to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/doctors-behind-your-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the expert, our Lead Dentist Jeffrey Suiltizer, DMD,</a> to get the answer.</p>
<p>Teeth grinding or clenching can be caused by stress or anxiety, but can also run in the family. (Thanks, Mom and Dad.) It can damage your teeth, jaw, or any crowns and cause headaches or pain.</p>
<p>If you grind or clench your teeth, you can still straighten your smile with SmileDirectClub; however, we recommend checking with your local doctor first. (You cannot use aligners if you are required to wear any other appliances for clenching or grinding, such as a night guard or splint, since aligners must be worn all day and night except when eating or drinking.)</p>
<p>Aligners may even help with mild grinding by acting as a protective barrier for your teeth. Aligners may wear down quicker as a result of clenching and grinding, but you will only wear each set of aligners for 1–2 weeks during treatment.</p>
<p>After treatment, we recommend replacing your <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/dont-forget-your-retainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmileDirectClub retainers</a> every 6 months to preserve your new grin, but you can order custom retainers made just for you as often as needed if you find that they’re wearing down sooner.</p>
<p>Our dental team does caution that wearing aligners may cause you to want to clench more, so check with your local doctor before beginning treatment.</p>
<p>Take the free 30-second assessment now to find out if you’re a candidate.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[From loose teeth to pain or discomfort, here’s how to deal with common side effects of wearing invisible aligners. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wearing clear aligners to reset your smile is a far cry from the hardware and rubber bands of yesteryear. But while the aligners might look almost invisible, they won&#8217;t necessarily feel invisible — because they&#8217;re working hard to give you your best smile. As they adjust your teeth, you&#8217;ll likely need to adjust to wearing them.</p>
<p>Here are some things that might happen when wearing aligners that are totally normal.</p>
<h3>1. Your mouth feels sore</h3>
<p>Your aligners have to put pressure on your teeth to get them moving, and that can feel uncomfortable. They’ll need some time to relax into wearing aligners, but most discomfort should go away after the first few days of a new set of aligners.</p>
<p>When you try a new sport or exercise move for the first time, muscles that aren&#8217;t accustomed to the new movement might feel sore the next day or few days. The same happens with aligners — you&#8217;re suddenly asking more of your mouth muscles and gums and teeth.</p>
<p>But just like working out, there&#8217;s a payoff if you keep wearing clear aligners. Taking an over-the-counter pain medicine, like ibuprofen, may help ease this pain just as it would easing post-workout muscle pain.</p>
<h3>2. Your teeth feel loose.</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t freak out. This is totally normal when wearing clear aligners.</p>
<p>Some people say teeth feel loose and mobile. That&#8217;s very, very normal, because we are moving them. It&#8217;s a different feeling for customers who have never been through an orthodontic treatment.</p>
<h3>3. Your teeth feel &#8230; funny</h3>
<p>Your aligners have to put pressure on your teeth to get them moving, and that can feel uncomfortable. They’ll need some time to relax into wearing aligners, but most discomfort should go away after the first few days of a new set of aligners. Even if you don’t feel discomfort, you’ll still notice the aligners in your mouth at first and it will probably feel a little odd. Don’t stress – we promise you’ll get used to it.</p>
<h3>4. The aligners don&#8217;t fit like you expected.</h3>
<p>Maybe they feel too loose, or they aren’t snapping into place correctly. If you’ve been wearing one set of aligners for a while, and they’re getting loose, that’s usually a good sign that the aligners are doing their job. If they aren’t snapping in, you can always use your <a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/movemints">Movemints</a>, or reach out to our dental team for any tips.</p>
<h3>5. An edge feels rough.</h3>
<p>When you go through your day and start talking, you may notice an edge that <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable/">feels rough or sharp</a>. This happens. You can use your emery board to lightly file that area. Be sure to file in the same direction to prevent any more rough edges.</p>
<h3>6. You may have a little lisp when wearing clear aligners.</h3>
<p>It won’t last, but, yeah, it’s real. Some people find that they speak with a bit of a lisp when first wearing aligners, but others don’t think it changes the way they talk at all. It depends on the person.</p>
<p>Just stick with it. After a few days, your mouth will adjust, and the lisp go away. And remember: You’re the one paying the most attention to your every word – most other people will likely never notice.</p>
<h3>7. You take a lot more selfies.</h3>
<p>Whether you’re just tracking progress (which we recommend) or enjoying the results you’re seeing, you’ll probably see your <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/take-an-instagram-worthy-after-selfie/">camera roll</a> fill up with lots of teeth pics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Take on concerts and music festivals this summer with confidence. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Take on concerts and music festivals this summer with confidence.</strong></h2>
<p>Summer fun and straighter teeth aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive. If you&#8217;ve got aligners and a summer calendar full of music festivals, concerts, or other all-day events where eating and drinking are on the agenda (and clean, private bathrooms are at a minimum), it&#8217;s important to be prepared.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know before heading off to a concert or music festival in your invisible aligners. Get ready to rock on.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bring a bag to store your case.</strong></h3>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a small purse with a zipper, a generously sized fanny pack, or a drawstring backpack, make sure to bring some sort of bag to stash your aligner case and <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/13-essentials-for-your-invisible-aligner-survival-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a few small essentials</a> (see below). Nothing will ruin a festival faster than realizing you accidentally threw away your aligners with your sweet potato fries.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Bring an empty water bottle.</strong></h3>
<p>Most music festivals will let you bring in an empty water bottle to fill up once you&#8217;re inside. You&#8217;ll save on overpriced bottled water that you&#8217;ll need in order to rinse after meals or snacks and drinks.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Pack a few mini disposable toothbrushes.</strong></h3>
<p>When you can&#8217;t full-on brush and floss, a disposable toothbrush will do the trick until you get home and can give your teeth a <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/?referrer=featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deep clean</a>. Just rinse, brush, rinse again and pop your aligners back into place after eating or drinking. Don&#8217;t forget a few <a href="https://www.dentalmovemints.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Movemints</a> and a floss pick in case you need to clean out stubborn bits of food. The only thing worse than food stuck in your teeth all day is food stuck in your aligners all day.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Sip on water. </strong></h3>
<p>You&#8217;re likely either outside in the blazing sun or packed into a hot, crowded room. Drink water. Since you can&#8217;t eat or drink anything other than cool water anyway while wearing aligners, stay hydrated and sip on water throughout the day/night. (And no, that does not include vodka sodas.) Drinking anything other than water while wearing your aligners can cause cavities and damage your aligners. Grabbing a drink or snack? Pop your aligners out and store them safely in their case inside your bag – not in your pocket or in a handful of napkins.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Don&#8217;t stress.</strong></h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about who will see you popping out your aligners or brushing with a disposable toothbrush. What&#8217;s most important is <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">keeping your teeth healthy</a> and keeping your new smile on track. So embrace your invisible aligners with the confidence of your favorite artists on stage. In an average of 4-6 months, when you&#8217;re showing off that new grin, you&#8217;ll be glad you did.</p>

<p>Once you start wearing your aligners, you&#8217;ll want to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brush and floss your teeth</a> after every meal or snack. If you&#8217;re not a regular flosser, start small by getting into the habit of flossing every day when you brush your teeth before leaving the house or going to bed.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>

<h3><b>7. Take a &#8220;before&#8221; picture,</b></h3>

<h3><b>8. Mark your calendar to order retainers.</b><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></h3>
<p>Another thing you can do while you&#8217;re waiting for your aligners is mark your calendar to order <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/dont-forget-your-retainers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retainers</a>. We recommend ordering retainers 4-5 weeks before treatment is complete to ensure they arrive in time, so mark your calendar now so you don&#8217;t forget later. You&#8217;ll want to have your retainers right when you finish your last set of aligners to preserve your beautiful new smile.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re headed to school, going to work, or jetting off on an epic vacation (in which case we&#8217;re jealous), there are a few things you should always take with you to <a href="https://smiledirectclub.com/blog/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners/">care for your clear aligners</a>.</p>
<p>First things first, find a small cosmetic case or toiletry bag where you can tuck away all your essentials. You&#8217;ll need this after each meal, snack, coffee break, and basically any time after you need to remove your aligners, so keep it handy. Putting together your care kit is a great way to get ready for your custom aligners to arrive.</p>
<p>(If you are going on vacation, don&#8217;t forget to pack your previous set of aligners in an extra case just in case you lose or break your current set.)</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for what to pack in your travel kit that&#8217;ll help make your life in aligners a breeze.</p>
<h2>Invisible aligner care tools travel checklist</h2>

<li>Case</li>
<li>Outie tool</li>
<li><a href="https://shop.smiledirectclub.com/products/electric-toothbrush-with-aligner-brush-head">Travel toothbrush </a></li>
<li>Travel toothpaste</li>
<li>Floss</li>
<li>Travel-size bottle of mouthwash (Pro tip: Pick a clear or whitening mouthwash to keep your pearly whites white.)</li>
<li>Your previous set of aligners</li>
