Bring your values to the office.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even if your current job isn\u2019t your dream job, bringing your compassion, kindness,\u00a0and\u00a0new ideas\u00a0can help you find what you\u2019re passionate about, Andrew says.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\">\r\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure to find a career path that also aligns with your passions (it&#8217;s hard enough to find a career path, period!). But bringing your passion to your current work is a good way to learn more about your interests and talents \u2013 and where they converge.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Put personal touches on your desk.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Personalize your space to make it both inspiring and smile-inducing. \u201cI\u2019m sensitive to my environment,\u00a0so music, my desk, even my outfit make a huge difference,\u201d Andrew says.\u00a0Bring in a photo of your pet or loved ones, a cute succulent, or display a card from a co-worker. And,\u00a0if you work in an open office, bring your headphones to really plug in and dial out distractions, she suggests.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. Celebrate others. <\/strong>\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Smile more with coworkers by celebrating both the little things and the big things, from\u00a0workiversaries\u00a0and birthdays to engagements and babies, to remind them how great they are. \u201cWe assume that our wonderful friends and colleagues know exactly what it is we value in them and why they\u2019re special, but people could be reminded of their talents daily, and it wouldn\u2019t be enough!\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Lift up your peers.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A few kind words can go a long way to brighten someone\u2019s day.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\">\r\n<p>\u201cEveryone can feel a little uneasy at work.
