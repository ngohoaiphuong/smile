I thought about (my teeth) constantly. I was hesitant to even smile.&#8221; Look at photos of her growing up, and Cassidy&#8217;s smiling with a closed mouth, to hide her teeth.<\/p>\n<p>About two years ago she decided to change her smile \u2014 and her life: She got SmileDirectClub aligners.<\/p>\n<p>Just six months later, she had a mouth full of straight, white teeth. Now she flashes a smile that flaunts her movie-star-worthy teeth. &#8220;I smile a lot more,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Now I have no problem talking to strangers or my friends.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>An affordable path to new confidence<\/h3>\n<p>Cassidy&#8217;s teeth had bothered her since she was a little kid. &#8220;I got made fun of for my teeth in elementary school,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I had buck teeth even then, and my teeth didn&#8217;t fit my face.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>All the teasing affected her personality, making her shy and withdrawn. &#8220;I got so cautious,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t eager to speak up or be noticed because people would judge my teeth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It seemed like a permanent condition. Her family never looked into getting her braces because they couldn&#8217;t afford them. &#8220;My family wasn&#8217;t in the top of the money scale. We had other things to pay for,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2018, when a 22-year-old Cassidy saw a Facebook ad for SmileDirectClub at 2 a.m. &#8220;I thought, &#8216;Hmm, that looks interesting,'&#8221; she says. While braces cost an average of US$5,000 to US$6,000, SmileDirectClub could straighten her teeth for up to 60% less than traditional braces. Cassidy was so impressed that she opened a savings account that week so she could start socking away money for her dream smile.<\/p>\n<h3>Empowering her own smile<\/h3>\n<p>Cassidy, a shift manager at a sandwich shop in Cleveland, spent the next nine months saving money for SmileDirectClub clear aligners. Her dad contributed money toward the cause too. &#8220;He had always known my teeth were a big insecurity for me, and he wanted to help,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>Cassidy had her initial 3D image done in a SmileDirectClub office in Cleveland. And she got her aligners in December 2018, right after her daughter, Elaina, was born. Talk about piling on the life changes. She was a new mom on her way to a new smile. &#8220;I figured it was a good time for me to try to do something for myself,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>To document the changes to her teeth \u2014 and share her smile journey with the world \u2014 Cassidy started an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cass_sdcjourney\/\">Instagram account<\/a> and posted photos of her teeth weekly. &#8220;There were times when I was feeling discouraged, like my teeth weren&#8217;t moving,&#8221; she says. &#8220;So I would go back and look at photos from a few months earlier, and it helped. I could see such a big difference.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>The world is smiling with her<\/h3>\n<p>When she returned to her job from maternity leave, after just three months in the aligners, her coworkers were blown away by her improved smile. &#8220;They all said, &#8216;Wow! You look great!'&#8221; Cassidy says. &#8220;It made me feel so good. I was still wearing aligners, but I was already getting compliments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When she completed her treatment in June 2019, she couldn&#8217;t believe the gorgeous grin beaming back at her in the mirror. &#8220;My teeth had shown a crazy-good amount of change,&#8221; she says. &#8220;My smile was great!&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>A new smile and more to smile about<\/h3>\n<p>A great smile has been life-changing. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to laugh at a joke, and I don&#8217;t think about how I have to hold my mouth so my teeth look OK,&#8221; Cassidy says. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a big weight off my shoulders.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cassidy says she&#8217;s more outgoing now, and the world seems bigger and friendlier. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think twice about talking to strangers,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I smile a lot more at people, and I feel like people are smiling more at me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And when she&#8217;s talking to customers throughout her 11-hour shifts at work, that means she&#8217;s spending a lot of her life as a more confident Cassidy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like confidence in a box,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Read why Cassidy says &#8216;it&#8217;s like confidence in a box.&#8217; Cassidy was never wild about her smile.
