Our case features built-in Bluetooth tracking technology powered by Tile and includes a slide-out mirror just like our standard aligner case.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA common reason that consumers\u2019 teeth-straightening process is interrupted is simply because they have lost their aligners or retainers,\u201d said Josh Chapman, Chief Global Brand Officer for SmileDirectClub. \u201cOur new case will help all Club members avoid that interruption as well as the potential cost of having to pay for any replacements.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><strong>How it works<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In order to utilize this feature, you\u2019ll need to download the Tile app (from the <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tile-find-lost-keys-phone\/id664939913\">Apple App Store<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.thetileapp.tile&amp;hl=en_US\">Google Play<\/a>) and create an account.
