We must say, that smile looks good on you!<\/p>\n<p>Your teeth have moved a lot recently and tend to want to shift back to their original position, but how can you make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen?<\/p>\n<h2>Retainers can keep your smile in place!<\/h2>\n<p>Just like with any orthodontic treatment, retainers are recommended to keep teeth from moving back to their starting point. Our clear retainers are designed to keep your smile from getting out of line.<\/p>\n<p>Whereas aligners are made out of specific plastics designed to gently move teeth and are not built for long-term use, retainers are made out of thicker .76mm thermoplastic polyurethane and work to maintain your results. One set of retainers lasts up to 6 months! Replacing them keeps the plastic strong and your smile in place.<\/p>\n<p>Lucky for you, we&#8217;ve made protecting your smile investment easy with a retainer subscription program. Simply purchase your first set and wear them as directed. Then, we&#8217;ll ship new retainers to you every 6 months. We&#8217;ve removed the hassle of remembering to order your next set and risking your teeth shifting back where they came from. Our retainer subscription makes it easy!<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to place your retainer order about 4-5 weeks before ending treatment, so you&#8217;ll have it just in time to show off that beautiful new smile.<\/p>\n<h2>Protecting your smile investment is easy with a retainer subscription!<\/h2>\n<p>Ready to order retainers to keep you grinning forever and ever?
