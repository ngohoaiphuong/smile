On Tuesday, the Nashville-based disruptor welcomed the Secretary to its Tennessee manufacturing facility, providing a tour of its 3D printing innovations and discussing their shared commitment to telehealth. When the pandemic hit, the proud U.S. manufacturer quickly pivoted the core use of their 3D printing manufacturing site from printing clear aligners for teeth straightening to creating over 60,000 face shields and other PPE for frontline healthcare workers &#8211; a move the Secretary called, \u201can example of the historic mobilization of the private sector.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe Secretary\u2019s visit was an important opportunity to shine a spotlight on the safety, efficacy, convenience of teledentistry and its applications for teeth straightening and remote care, all at significantly reduced costs.\u00a0 We look forward to working with the Department of Health and Human Services to broaden access to care, especially for communities in remote or underserved locations.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\u2013 Dr. Jeffrey Sulitzer, Chief Clinical Officer at SmileDirectClub<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>As a pioneer of teledentistry, SmileDirectClub is democratizing the oral care industry, increasing access to affordable teeth-straightening treatment, a service that has historically evaded underserved communities across the U.S. By removing the cost-prohibitive barrier of traditional orthodontic treatment and creating a variety of on-ramps for customers, including an at-home impression kit option, SmileDirectClub is not only increasing access to consumers, it\u2019s revolutionizing the way they think about healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/watch\/live\/?v=606552123604675&amp;ref=watch_permalink\">The Hill\u2019s Virtual Town Hall, \u201cHealth Reimagined: The Future of Healthcare<\/a>,\u201d Secretary Azar noted that telehealth is here to stay. \u201cI think we&#8217;d have a revolution if anyone tried to go backwards on this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is now I think an embedded part of our health care system.
