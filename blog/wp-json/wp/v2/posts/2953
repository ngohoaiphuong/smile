Many of his friends \u2013 all approaching their senior year of high school in greater Los Angeles \u2013 wore braces, and some had them for over 2\u00bd years.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>\u201cThe experience looked awful.

So when Gus had his 3D scan done at a SmileShop in Manhattan Beach, he took the entire family. Gus\u2019s mom had braces when she was young and was a bit skeptical about how much treatment was included for the price of aligners. Everyone had questions.<\/p>\n<p>But the manager did a great job of explaining how \u201cyour dentist will design and oversee Gus\u2019s plan\u201d \u2013 because one specific dentist really does direct an individual\u2019s entire smile journey. And the family was pleasantly surprised that it would all be included in the price.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>\u201cThat conversation really took away any doubt,\u201d says Junior. <\/strong><strong>\u201cKnowing we could turn to someone specifically for guidance if we needed it.\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Gus was very proud showing off his 3D scan to his family and seeing how it reassured them.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>\u201cI still have the pictures on my phone.\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Proving his responsibility to his family \u2013 and himself.<\/h2>\n<p>Before Gus started his treatment, Junior had many talks with him about sticking with the plan. \u201cI wanted him to understand the gravity of the investment \u2013 not just short-term but long-term.\u201d Gus was aware of the financial investment his family was making and let them know he was on board with the commitment.<\/p>\n<p>When the purple box arrived, \u201cIt was like, okay, it\u2019s time, I\u2019m going to do it!\u201d Gus says. And it turned out that he did a great job keeping up with his treatment \u2013 even at school. \u201cAfter the first month, it was pretty easy.\u201d Many kids didn\u2019t realize for months that he was wearing aligners.<\/p>\n<p>His father was beyond impressed. Says Junior, \u201cHe did a really great job following the process.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>\u201cHe stuck to it. He didn\u2019t lose one aligner. <\/strong><strong>I don\u2019t think he fell out of the treatment plan once.\u201d<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Seeing proof \u2013 and using it as motivation.<\/h2>\n<p>Gus had his school picture taken right before he started treatment. That was his reference point for seeing changes \u2013 because though he could feel his teeth shifting, he didn\u2019t really see it until later. Now, he sees a photo of himself in the family living room and can clearly make the comparison. He\u2019s very proud of it.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>\u201cHe\u2019ll take you to the living room where his school portrait is hanging <\/strong><strong>and point out the differences,\u201d says Junior.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>After a 6-month treatment plan, he loves his new smile \u2013 even if the pandemic means he can\u2019t really show it off yet.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2956 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_Gustavo-285x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"537\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_Gustavo-285x300.jpg 285w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_Gustavo-971x1024.jpg 971w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_Gustavo-768x810.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_Gustavo.jpg 996w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Feeling confident in their choices \u2013 and in Gus\u2019s new smile.<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cI see people struggle who don\u2019t have straight teeth, and the lack of confidence some of them have,\u201d says Junior. \u201cAs Gus goes to college and starts to build his own life, he\u2019ll start out a step above.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI feel proud that we as parents made the right decision for him and his future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gus is glad they trusted him. \u201cI do feel more confident now that I don\u2019t have to get those questions, \u2018Do you need braces?
