His orthodontist was 45 minutes away, and he wasn&#8217;t always able to make the 90-minute round trip every month for adjustments. He&#8217;d also recently gotten his scuba diving license, was gifted some gear, and had the opportunity to visit family in Indonesia for a long scuba diving trip. Metal braces didn&#8217;t jibe with extended international travel, so he had to choose. He chose the once in a lifetime experience and had the braces taken off.<mark class=\"\" data-mark-id=\"3bc517e0-81a6-483a-af92-dbb4ce983adc\"><\/mark><\/p>\n<p>By the time Rainer reached his senior year of high school, he hated his teeth. But he still didn&#8217;t want to wear braces. Braces made him look younger, he says, and he wasn&#8217;t having it.<\/p>\n<p>Then Rainer saw a SmileDirectClub ad on Instagram. He clicked through for more information and liked what he saw: straight teeth in months instead of years, with no monthly orthodontist visits, and no metal mouth. And all at less than half the average <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/blog\/how-much-does-smiledirectclub-cost\/\">cost<\/a> of braces.<\/p>\n<h2>He made an appointment that day<\/h2>\n<p>Never one to hesitate, Rainer made an appointment for that day for an initial consultation at a <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smileshops\/\">SmileDirectClub office<\/a> that was 20 minutes away from his home in Santa Cruz, California.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;An hour and a half later, I was walking into the office in San Jose,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I was just super impressed by the whole experience.

He did his <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/blog\/smile-direct-club-3d-image\/\">3D scan<\/a> and made a down payment that day. His purple box of standard clear aligners arrived at his door soon afterward. He wore his aligners as directed, at least 22 hours a day. His teeth got straighter after just three weeks of wearing his aligners. &#8220;It was a great feeling to see progress and know that you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>Four months later, Rainer had the straight, white teeth he had always wanted.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone from never smiling in photos to having a nice, big, wide smile in all my photos,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s changed the way I interact with people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>He finished high school with straight teeth<\/h2>\n<p>Rainer couldn&#8217;t believe how <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/how_it_works\/\">easy<\/a> it was to get straight teeth.<\/p>\n<p>His friends never noticed he was wearing aligners, and the discomfort was manageable. &#8220;It was just an amazing experience from start to finish,&#8221; Rainer says. &#8220;It was really simple to follow the instructions and stick with it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He really loved not having to go to the orthodontist every month, like he had done when he had braces.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-3105\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/RainerA.jpg\" alt=\"Rainer flashes his new smile after SmileDirectClub aligners\" width=\"385\" height=\"627\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/RainerA.jpg 1216w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/RainerA-184x300.jpg 184w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/RainerA-629x1024.jpg 629w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/RainerA-768x1250.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/RainerA-944x1536.jpg 944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Rainer&#8217;s mother, Erin, loved that he stuck with the plan this time. She had been hesitant to pay for SmileDirectClub aligners, even though they were <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/pricing\/\">affordable<\/a>, because she had already paid for braces for Rainier\u2014$5,000 worth. She had not been thrilled when he insisted on taking them off so he could travel, but she had supported his decision.<\/p>\n<p>But she was impressed with Rainer&#8217;s initiative in researching SmileDirectClub and then making the initial appointment himself. Even more impressive, Rainer had been working and saving up for a few years, so he was able to pay for the aligners upfront himself. Erin couldn&#8217;t be more proud of Rainer.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;He stuck to the SmileDirectClub plan and was right on schedule changing out his aligners,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It was gratifying to me to see how disciplined he was.&#8221; She credits SmileDirectClub&#8217;s treatment program with helping Rainer stay on track without her supervision. &#8220;I was impressed with how user-friendly it was,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>She sees a change in her son now that his teeth are straight. \u201cHe smiles more.
