Instead of taking your own photos and impressions, a SmileGuide captures a 3D image of your smile. That image will then be used to create your custom invisible aligners to straighten your teeth.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/227910945\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>How does the 3D image work?<\/h3>\n<p>Head to your<a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smileshops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> local SmileShop<\/a> for an easy, 30-minute appointment with one of our experienced SmileGuides.<\/p>\n<p>The SmileGuide will use a handheld 3D camera that takes 6,000 photos per second (yep, per second) to create a digital map of your smile. They&#8217;ll glide the camera over your teeth to make sure they capture every part of your smile. Once your appointment is complete, it&#8217;s sent to a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">state-licensed dentist or orthodontist<\/a> in our network who will\u00a0evaluate your smile. The doctor overseeing your case will then create your personal treatment plan, which will show you how your new smile will look.<\/p>\n<h3>Who are\u00a0the SmileGuides?<\/h3>\n<p>Our SmileGuides come from a variety of backgrounds and are trained to efficiently and accurately capture a 3D image of your smile. Many of our SmileGuides are registered dental assistants or dental hygienists. We actively monitor and evaluate the quality of their work, including your experience. Our SmileGuides are able to answer any questions you have about our service, our process, and our technology, as well as most questions about straightening your smile using invisible aligners.<\/p>\n<h3>What happens after my appointment?<\/h3>\n<p>Your 3D image is the beginning of your journey toward your new grin. The smile you&#8217;ll love is only a few steps away.
