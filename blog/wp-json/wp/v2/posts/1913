But to take your smile to the next level of brilliance, there&#8217;s <strong>nothing like bright on teeth whitening<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/r8XdASWeihQ?rel=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>What makes <b>bright on\u2122<\/b> so effective at teeth whitening?<\/h2>\n<p>There are a lot of popular teeth-whitening options out there, including whitening toothpastes, rinses and dental-office whitening treatments. But unfortunately, many store-bought products contain trace amounts of the actual ingredients that whiten your teeth. And dental-office whitening requires several appointments and can be expensive.<\/p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to pay premium prices for premium teeth whitening. The bright on teeth whitening system with our unique <strong>Bright Boost\u2122 formula<\/strong> has the same enamel-safe whitening agent used by dentists \u2014 for half the cost.<\/p>\n<p>Just five minutes in the morning and evening gets you to your brightest bright in one week without disrupting everyday life. The no-mess brush applicator keeps gel off your hands and on your teeth, and an available LED accelerator light makes the Bright Boost\u2122 formula work even faster.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3171\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/pen-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/>It takes only four<a href=\"https:\/\/shop.smiledirectclub.com\/products\/teeth-whitening-pens-8-pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> bright on pens<\/a> to whiten your smile, and most users <strong>see results within a week<\/strong>. For a continuously bright smile, whiten for one week every six months.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re proud of the fact that bright on is also vegan, gluten-free and soy-free. Plus, it comes in a cool mint flavor. Here&#8217;s how to whiten your teeth with bright on \u2014 and transform your life, starting with your smile.<\/p>\n<h2>How to whiten teeth with <b>bright on\u2122 <\/b>premium teeth whitening:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Use morning and evening daily for one week.<\/li>\n<li>Brush teeth first, but do not floss.<\/li>\n<li>Open the <strong>bright on<\/strong> pen and slowly twist the bottom until gel is visible on the brush.<\/li>\n<li>Brush the gel onto your front top and bottom teeth in a circular motion and wear for five minutes. Avoid putting gel on your gums. The gel will lightly foam as it penetrates.<\/li>\n<li>After five minutes, spit out the excess foam. Do not rinse, eat or drink for 20 minutes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Turbo-charge <b>bright on\u2122<\/b> with the LED accelerator light:<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>After applying the gel, plug the light into your phone using the appropriate attachment and insert the light into your mouth.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Keep the light on for five minutes<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>After five minutes, remove the light and unplug it from your phone. Spit out excess foam if needed.<\/li>\n<li>Using lukewarm water, rinse and wipe off the mouthpiece. Allow the light to dry in a well-ventilated place.<\/li>\n<li>Once the light is dry, pack it into its plastic case. Because the case has limited space, we suggest removing the detachable Android and iPhone cables from the LED light to avoid damaging them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Tips for <b>bright on\u2122<\/b> teeth whitening:<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not rinse, eat or drink <strong>for 20 minutes<\/strong> after you&#8217;re done.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid staining foods and drinks, such as coffee, chocolate or red wine for 24 hours.<\/li>\n<li>The LED accelerator light and cables are waterproof; however, the USB Android and iPhone adapters are not. Do not let the adapters get wet. If they do get wet, dry them off immediately.<\/li>\n<li>Remember to whiten for one week every six months.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ready to start unlocking the power of a brighter, whiter smile?
