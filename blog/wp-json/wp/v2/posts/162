From the start of his career, Dr. Sulitzer aimed to impact oral health on a large scale. After graduating from the Temple University School of Dentistry in 1985, he spent more than a decade serving as Vice President of U.S. Healthcare\u2019s dental division. Meanwhile, he continued to see his own patients in his private practice. Though his private practice afforded him the luxury of meeting patients in person, it was impossible for the dentist to see more than 15 patients daily, and Dr. Sulitzer was driven to access more people with different resources.<\/p>\n<p>SmileDirectClub provides a unique opportunity for him to improve the lives of thousands of people, and we\u2019re thrilled to have him here. Dr. Sulitzer receives questions daily concerning everything from the results of your impression kits to the general health benefits of oral health. Below are 12 of your most commonly asked questions, as answered by Dr. S.<\/p>\n<h2>Are there doctors affiliated with SmileDirectClub?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, every customer is assigned a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">state licensed dentist or orthodontist<\/a> to oversee their case. Doctors affiliated with SmileDirectClub are state licensed orthodontists, or general dentists with orthodontic experience, who enjoy helping their patients achieve the smile their patients have always wanted.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the most common signs that someone might benefit from SmileDirectClub invisible aligners?<\/h2>\n<p>Two of the most common signs you might benefit from SmileDirectClub are (1) slight crowding and\/or (2) spacing in your upper or lower front teeth. This could result from previous brackets\/wires you had in the past: meaning your teeth have either become more crowded or more spread out than they were after your braces were taken off, or maybe you have not had braces before but would like to correct the natural crowding or spacing in your upper or lower front teeth.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of SmileDirectClub?<\/h2>\n<p>SmileDirectClub is a great way to improve upon your smile in a way that fits your lifestyle. We can treat you under a doctor&#8217;s care without having you go to the orthodontic office once every 4\u20136 weeks. You can get the results you\u2019re looking for, and the cost of our program is up to 60% less than traditional braces.<\/p>\n<h2>I\u2019m 13 years old. Is there a chance that my bite will improve on its own?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to say unless we can review your clinical information. I would recommend that you submit your information, and then we can see what is best for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Why can\u2019t children 12 years old and younger use aligners from SmileDirectClub?<\/h2>\n<p>Aligner therapy is not an appropriate orthodontic therapy for children under 12, as they have more complicated tooth movement-needs that may involve their facial development. Children who are at least 12 years old and have all their permanent teeth may be a great candidate for SmileDirectClub.<\/p>\n<h2>My child has early signs of orthodontic problems. Should we wait until he\u2019s old enough to receive aligners from SmileDirectClub before correcting them?<\/h2>\n<p>Most orthodontists recommend what we call \u201cinterceptive orthodontics,\u201d which entail certain processes utilized by orthodontists to begin correcting tooth and jaw malalignments. Interceptive orthodontics are realized via conventional brackets\/bands, rubber bands, appliances and \u201chead gear.\u201d Following an interceptive approach, the person may need more brackets\/banding or may be a candidate for aligner therapy. This can be determined by reviewing the clinical information after the interceptive care is completed.<\/p>\n<h2>It is normal for my permanent teeth to loosen during my new smile journey?<\/h2>\n<p>Permanent teeth can become a bit loose during your aligner treatment, and this is not unusual. In fact, in many cases, it is part of the process. If you feel they are becoming \u201cvery\u201d loose, however, or if they move more than you think is right, please reach out to us so we can correct any issue by finding out more about how you are progressing through your treatment.<\/p>\n<h2>Is it normal to feel slight pain when wearing aligners?<\/h2>\n<p>It is normal to feel <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/do-invisible-aligners-hurt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">slight pain<\/a> when wearing aligners. In fact, it is a part of the process and tells us that it is working. In a few days after starting treatment, the pain will subside.<\/p>\n<h2>Should I still see my regular dentist while on my new smile journey?<\/h2>\n<p>You should continue to visit your regular dentist while you are working on your great smile with us. Dental cleanings and other treatments, if necessary, should continue while you are improving your smile. If you have any questions concerning additional dental needs, you should check in with us so we can coordinate the needed treatment with your regular dentist.<\/p>\n<h2>Why are retainers needed after my new smile journey is complete?<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/dont-forget-your-retainers\/\">Retainers<\/a> are needed to prevent relapse. Without retainers, your teeth won\u2019t stay in the nice, new position you have worked so hard to get them into. We recommend wearing your retainers for the first 2 weeks after completing treatment. Then, after 2 weeks, we suggest wearing them at night.<\/p>\n<h2>Can you be too old for orthodontic treatment?<\/h2>\n<p>You can never be too old for orthodontic therapy. In fact, I am 57 years old and starting my treatment shortly as I want to have a better smile, like the one I had after braces when I was only 16 years old.<\/p>\n<h2>Are there foods to avoid during my new smile journey?<\/h2>\n<p>As always, you should avoid eating any foods that are sticky and\/or full of sugar, as they promote cavities. Most importantly, make sure you brush 3 times a day and floss once, each and every day.<\/p>\n<p><i>Thank you, Dr. Sulitzer!
