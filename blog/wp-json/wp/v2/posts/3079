She took her <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\/\">impressions<\/a>, and used the smile stretcher to take photos of all of her teeth, as SmileDirectClub suggests.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I looked at the picture after I was done and I was like, &#8216;I&#8217;m going through with it.

That was toward the end of February. Around the beginning of March, she received her first aligners.<\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, Diana started sharing personal videos to document the silly toddler antics in her home on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NTXQChvilP0&amp;t=31s\">YouTube<\/a>. This year she added personal testimonials about her journey to a better smile and new confidence. She posted video blog entries of her experiences online. She had seen some negative feedback about SmileDirectClub, and saw that many potential customers had questions. Her videos aim to ease those concerns by walking viewers through her experiences at every point.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3085\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM.png\" alt=\"Diana with her husband and two children\" width=\"717\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM.png 2136w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-1024x678.png 1024w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-768x508.png 768w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-1536x1017.png 1536w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screen-Shot-2021-01-11-at-9.51.47-AM-2048x1356.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In sum: The process and the aligners really do work. And the reactions she&#8217;s gotten to her videos have been overwhelmingly positive.<\/p>\n<p>Diana&#8217;s advice to anyone interested in SmileDirectClub is to try it \u2013 and also make sure to follow the guidelines. In her case, she needed to wear her aligners <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/how_it_works\/\">22 hours a day<\/a>, and she stuck to that.
