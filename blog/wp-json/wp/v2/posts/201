Money deducted from your paycheck is not subject to payroll taxes, and it\u2019s not taxed when you withdraw it. FSAs are available through your employer, and you need to define the amount of money you\u2019ll contribute to your account for the year during open enrollment. Funds expire at the end of the year, so you need to use them or lose them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is a health savings account (HSA)?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An HSA is a medical savings account available to people who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Funds put into the account aren\u2019t subject to federal income tax at the time of deposit, and you don\u2019t pay any taxes on money you withdraw for medical expenses. With an HSA, even one provided through your employer, the money and the account are yours, and the funds roll over from year to year.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How can I purchase invisible aligners using my HSA or FSA?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you have a debit card associated with your HSA or FSA account, simply process your payment on our site like you would any credit card. If you have an HSA\/FSA without a debit card, give us a call so we can help you process it.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does SmileDirectClub take payments through insurance?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your dental plan provides orthodontic benefits, you may be covered for SmileDirectClub aligners. As of November 2020, SmileDirectClub is in network with UnitedHealthCare, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire BlueCross BlueShield.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/insurance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more here.<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you have a money-back guarantee?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We sure do.
