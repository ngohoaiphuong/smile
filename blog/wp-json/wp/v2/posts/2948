Often, she had to be the adult, taking care of her mother, putting the family\u2019s needs before her own. And braces were far from affordable.<\/p>\n<p>So Chamani never smiled. She avoided cameras too. \u201cI wouldn&#8217;t take a picture to save my life,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cI was constantly trying to not smile. <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>And it\u2019s hard when you feel like you have to be in a shell.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>But at 25, she decided to change her smile and her life.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Choosing to smile (for free!).<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>She began researching the cost of fixing her teeth. Braces were still beyond her reach. But a SmileDirectClub online ad, promising she could get her teeth straightened for less than half the cost of traditional braces, caught her eye.<\/p>\n<p>Chamani took the plunge and ordered a SmileDirectClub impression kit. She made the molds of her teeth, sent them back, got a prescription, and began saving for the $200 down payment.<\/p>\n<p>Then she got an email from SmileDirectClub inviting her to enter their Gift of Grin contest. If she could tell them in an essay why she deserved a new smile, she could win a free smile treatment. She entered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI wrote about how all my life I have done for other people.\u201d Chamani shared how she took care of her mom when she was a kid. How, as an adult, she helped her mom escape her abusive father. And how she spent 3 years serving her country in the Air Force.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cFixing my smile would be the first time I did something for me, <\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>completely focusing on my joy and my happiness.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Her essay won \u2013 and Chamani got her aligners for free.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2951 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_ChamaniJpg-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"513\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_ChamaniJpg-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_ChamaniJpg-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_ChamaniJpg-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_ChamaniJpg-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/3_ChamaniJpg-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Fixing her smile transformed her outlook.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Chamani saw results, fast.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight at the 1-month mark, my front teeth were almost touching,\u201d she says. Her friends and co-workers noticed too. \u201cPeople said, \u2018Is your face changing? Are you changing your teeth?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When she finished her treatment, Chamani couldn&#8217;t believe the transformation. The aligners had closed that gap, and a couple of whitening treatments had made her teeth as bright as alabaster.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cPeople tell me now that they didn&#8217;t talk to me because I never smiled. <\/strong><strong>It&#8217;s a shame how many interactions didn&#8217;t happen because of my teeth.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Now she had a movie-star smile and every reason to share it.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Finding new confidence, relationships, and a career.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201cBeing uncomfortable with yourself is such a heavy burden,\u201d she says. \u201cI&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have it anymore.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Her new confidence gave her the courage to pursue her long-term goal of becoming a midwife. She has started nursing school in Wilmington, North Carolina, with plans to get an associate degree, transfer to a 4-year school for an undergraduate nursing degree, and then complete a 3-year midwifery program.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2952 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5_Chamani_After2-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"515\" height=\"687\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5_Chamani_After2-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5_Chamani_After2-769x1024.jpg 769w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5_Chamani_After2-scaled.jpg 1923w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" \/><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>\u201cChanging my smile changed everything.<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>Now, anything I want to do, I have the confidence to do.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cFixing my smile has removed fear from my life,\u201d Chamani says. \u201cSince then, I&#8217;ve made more friends, I started school, I am in study groups, and all of these things are making me more successful.
