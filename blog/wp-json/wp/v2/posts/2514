After all the hard work we\u2019ve done together, you owe it to yourself to wear your SmileDirectClub retainers nightly to keep that gorgeous grin in place.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Still have questions about retainers? We\u2019ve got answers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How are retainers different from aligners?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>SmileDirectClub retainers are made of thicker .76mm thermoplastic polyurethane and built to keep your teeth from moving back to their original position. They last up to 6 months.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why can\u2019t I just wear my last set of aligners?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Aligners are made using specific plastics designed to gently move teeth and are not built for long-term use. They will eventually crack.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Do I have to get new retainers every 6 months?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While you can clean them, they will still get dirty and degrade over time. Replacing them keeps the plastic strong and your smile in place since the retainers will stretch out over time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Do I really have to wear retainers forever? <\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you will need to wear your retainers every night for the rest of your life \u2013 or for as long as you want your straight smile to last. But you can grin happily, knowing your teeth won\u2019t shift back.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How do I clean my retainers?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You\u2019ll clean your retainers the same as you did your clear aligners. Here are <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners\/\">5 ways you can clean your aligners<\/a> to keep them fresh.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do I do if my retainer breaks?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Accidents happen, grinner.
