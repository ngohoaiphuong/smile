Like, how does SmileDirectClub work, anyway? We understand. At SmileDirectClub, we want you to feel as confident with our aligners as you will be with your new smile.<\/p>\n<p>First, SmileDirectClub aligners are a series of doctor-directed, custom-fitting plastic trays that help straighten teeth that need mild to moderate adjustment, for up to 60% less than traditional braces. And our average treatment time is 4-6 months.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what else you should know about using our clear aligners.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1749 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/treatment-2.gif\" alt=\"smile direct club plan\" width=\"800\" height=\"532\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>1. SmileDirectClub is a great fit for many: Our aligners work best for mild to moderate concerns.<\/h3>\n<p>SmileDirectClub aligners are designed for minor to moderate crowding, spacing, and general alignment concerns. The aligners can fit over wisdom teeth, crowns and fillings. But if you just had a crown put in, you may want to wait a few months before popping in aligners.<\/p>\n<p>Also, aligners won&#8217;t shift implanted teeth (which are screwed to the bone and can&#8217;t move). Our aligners are for anyone 12 and up \u2014 you must have all your adult teeth. We also recommend a good cleaning from your local dentist, and filling any cavities, before using aligners.<\/p>\n<h3>2. You&#8217;ll start with a 3D image.<\/h3>\n<p>To create your custom treatment plan, we need to see your current smile. You can schedule a free, 30-minute appointment at one of our <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smileshops\/\">SmileShops<\/a>, or you can make your own impressions with an <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\">Impression Kit<\/a>. This image is used to create your treatment plan, which is reviewed and approved by the state licensed dentist or orthodontist overseeing your case.<\/p>\n<h3>3. You&#8217;ll get a sneak peek of your new smile.<\/h3>\n<p>Within about 72 hours, you&#8217;ll receive a preview of what your new smile will look like. You can log into your SmileDirectClub account or hop onto our app for a 3D view. You can get a complete view of how your teeth will move over the course of your treatment.<\/p>\n<h3>4. You&#8217;ll be assigned a state licensed dentist or orthodontist.<\/h3>\n<p>We work with a network of over <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\">250 dentists and orthodontists<\/a>, and each Club member is assigned one who is licensed where you live. This doctor will oversee your new smile and will schedule regular virtual check-ins with you. During treatment, you can talk to our Dental team or your doctor directly if you have any concerns.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Wearing aligners takes some adjustment &#8212; and care.<\/h3>\n<p>How long does SmileDirectClub take? We get that one a lot. You&#8217;ll wear aligners 22 hours a day (or 10 consecutive hours if you&#8217;re using Nighttime Aligners\u2122). The average treatment time for aligners is 4-6 months, or 8-10 for Nighttime Aligners\u2122. You may feel some soreness when you first use new aligners, just as you might <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/blog\/things-that-might-happen-wearing-aligners-that-are-totally-normal\">feel sore<\/a> after using new muscles at the gym \u2014 that&#8217;s expected.<\/p>\n<p>You can eat whatever you want, just remove the aligners before doing so or before drinking anything other than water. Brush your teeth before you pop them back in. You&#8217;ll need to <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/blog\/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners\">clean your aligners<\/a>, but we make that pretty easy.<\/p>\n<h3>6. You need to finish the whole treatment plan.<\/h3>\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve hit month three, and your teeth don&#8217;t seem to have shifted much. Everyone&#8217;s smile journey is different and some Club members may see movement sooner than others. If you&#8217;re ever worried, you can always give us a call and we can make sure you&#8217;re on track.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Retainers keep everything in place long-term.<\/h3>\n<p>After aligners have finished, you&#8217;ll wear a retainer to keep everything in place. Otherwise, teeth naturally want to shift back to their original spot. After two weeks of round-the-clock wear, you&#8217;ll keep the retainer in only at night. Like the aligners, retainers are clear and cleanable. We recommend replacing them every six months or so.<\/p>\n<h3>8. You still need regular dental checkups.<\/h3>\n<p>Despite all our fancy technology and skilled dental experts on-call 24\/7, we don&#8217;t have the ability to clean teeth or fill a cavity from afar. You&#8217;ll want to keep your twice-yearly checkup and cleaning schedule as you would even without SmileDirectClub aligners.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more success with tooth movement when there&#8217;s better periodontal health,&#8221; Dr. Sulitzer says.<\/p>\n<p>Your dentist can help ensure nothing seems out of place and keep your new smile healthy and glowing.<\/p>\n<h3>9. SmileDirectClub comes with 24\/7 support from our Customer Care team.<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re with you for your entire treatment plan. Our Customer Care team is ready to help via chat, email, phone and social media 24\/7. They can take your questions, listen to your concerns and hear out your SmileDirectClub reviews. Whatever is on your mind, we&#8217;re here for you.<\/p>\n<p>Take it from Rachel J.:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customer care is outstanding. Phone calls answered very quickly and very helpful staff. Emails also answered very quickly. I received my invisible aligners and started my journey to straighter and whiter teeth (I also got complimentary whitening gel, which I could use with my aligners! Super easy). Customer care emailed me every time my aligners needed to be changed, so I never forgot. The time flew by and now my teeth look so much better than they did before. Bonus \u2026 Nobody knew I was wearing them!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of compliments about how great my smile is. I would highly recommend SmileDirectClub to anyone wanting to improve their smile.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Ready to get straight teeth for 60% less than traditional braces? <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get started today with our free Smile Assessment!<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ready to achieve alignment?
