It\u2019s a natural first step in your journey to unlocking the power of your smile. Some Club members may not experience any discomfort, but we have some tips for those of you who do.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few easy <strong>tips for making your aligners more comfortable<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2>1.\u00a0Switch your aligners at night<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll have the whole night to get used to the feel of your aligners and will probably sleep through most of the discomfort. If you\u2019re using SmileDirectClub Nighttime Aligners\u2122, you\u2019re one step ahead of the game here.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Use your Movemints.<\/h2>\n<p>Included in your aligners box, <strong>Movemints are mints<\/strong> designed to help your aligners sit better.<\/p>\n<p>They help seat your aligners and make them more comfortable in your mouth, especially if you&#8217;re having trouble getting the aligners to snap in all the way or if there&#8217;s a little extra space between your teeth and the aligners.<\/p>\n<p>Put them in your mouth and chew on them several times a day until your aligners fit better. They&#8217;ll also provide an extra minty flavor while seating your aligners.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Use the emery board, if needed.<\/h2>\n<p>If you need to do any fine-tuning on the shape of your aligners, the emery board in your aligner box will be your friend. You can use it to lightly file down any sharp or rough edges on your aligners. If there\u2019s any excess material on your aligners, just use small scissors to cut it off, and then use an emery board to file the new edge.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Use dental wax to cushion sore areas.<\/h2>\n<p>You can put a small wad of dental wax between your aligners and your teeth in any areas that feel particularly sore. The wax will help cushion your teeth as you get used to your aligners. We recommend applying the wax to dry aligners to ensure that it stays in place.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Eat cold, soothing foods.<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2761 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/popsicle.png\" alt=\"raspberry popsicle\" width=\"417\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/popsicle.png 750w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/popsicle-300x230.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Cold popsicles, smoothies and frozen fruit are all delicious snacks, but their cool temperatures can also help to soothe a sore mouth. Give it a try \u2014 but don&#8217;t forget that you have to remove your aligners before eating or drinking anything other than cool water.<\/p>\n<p>If you want some prolonged cooling relief but don&#8217;t feel like eating anything, <strong>applying an ice pack to the outside of your mouth<\/strong> can have a similar effect.<\/p>\n<p>You may also consider<strong> taking some Tylenol, Advil, or Aleve<\/strong>\u00a0for two to three days to help ease any pain.<\/p>\n<h3>Bonus tip: Hang in there.<\/h3>\n<p>Whatever you do, keep wearing your aligners. If you stop for a day or two, it&#8217;ll become harder to put them back in, which could make the discomfort last longer than it would otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve tried a few remedies and you&#8217;re still feeling discomfort, or if you&#8217;re experiencing significant pain, call our Customer Care team right away. They can provide additional tips specific to your treatment plan to make your teeth aligners easier to wear.<\/p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget that despite some temporary discomfort, the outcome of your smile journey will be worth it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do your aligners sometimes feel a little strange?
