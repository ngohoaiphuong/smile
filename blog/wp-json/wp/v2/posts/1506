It&#8217;s doctor-directed.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To start, we have a minimum age requirement of 12 years old, plus all customers must have all permanent teeth present and be in good dental health to get started. A <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">state licensed dentist or orthodontist<\/a> reviews and approved every smile plan and oversees each case to make sure everything is moving along as it should. Another perk: All the extra brushing and flossing with clear aligners makes for <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions\/?referrer=featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">better overall dental hygiene<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. It&#8217;s affordable.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s break down the costs. Teen braces can be pretty expensive. In-office aligners can require attachments and cost nearly $5000 or more. SmileDirectClub aligners only cost $1950, and we also offer the option of easy monthly payments, so your teen could get the smile they love for only $250 down and less than $89 per month. No credit checks. No forms to fill out. Visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pricing page<\/a> for all the details.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. It&#8217;s perfect for busy kids.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re on the road with traveling sports or sending the kids off to summer camp, you won&#8217;t have to worry about regular office appointments with SmileDirectClub aligners. With our teledentistry model, everything is done under the remote care of a state licensed dentist or orthodontist. We also ship all of the aligners out to you at once, so there&#8217;s no waiting around for your next set of aligners. But this doesn&#8217;t mean you go it alone. You will have regular virtual check-ins with your doctor to see how your teeth are moving, and you can reach out to us at any time of day with any questions along the way. We&#8217;re here for you!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. It&#8217;s a great option for most kids.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>SmileDirectClub&#8217;s clear aligners are a great option for most kids. Our aligners are designed for minor to moderate teeth correction, including space between teeth, crowding, rotations, and some bite correction. Get started with a doctor-prescribed, easy-to-use, at-home <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\/?w=impr\">impression kit<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/locations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">visit your local SmileShop<\/a> for a free 3D image with one of our experienced SmileGuides so their smile can be evaluated by a state licensed dentist or orthodontist in our network. <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/how_it_works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more about getting started here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. It&#8217;s easy.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You can go into a nearby SmileShop to complete a 3D image in just 30 minutes or get started with a remote impression kit. Once you get started, our treatment plans only take an average of 4-6 months. The aligners are removable, meaning there are no food restrictions, and your teen won&#8217;t have to get them adjusted or wear rubber bands or headgear.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. The aligners really are clear. <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Our aligners are made from a durable thermoplastic PET-G that&#8217;s BPA-free and identical to the shape of your teeth. Our aligners are made with Comfort Sense\u2122 technology, ensuring that they&#8217;re comfortable. The smooth plastic won&#8217;t irritate cheeks or gums like traditional braces. They&#8217;re clear and discreet, and unlike most aligners, they&#8217;re matte, not shiny, which makes them look more natural and less noticeable because they won&#8217;t reflect light. They also won&#8217;t photobomb high school dance pictures for the next four years.<\/p>\n<p>SmileDirectclub aligners are a great option for most teens.
