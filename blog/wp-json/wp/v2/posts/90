Having clear, easy-to-see photos is the easiest way to speed up your SmileDirectClub evaluation process.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Make sure your photos match the samples.<\/h2>\n<p>When you upload your photos, you\u2019ll be able to see samples of what your images should look like. If the angle or focus (or really any part) of your pictures doesn\u2019t match these images, you need to retake them!<\/p>\n<h2>2. Don\u2019t take the photos yourself.<\/h2>\n<p>Unless you absolutely have to, don\u2019t take your own photos. It\u2019s difficult to take close, in-focus photos that capture all of your teeth when you take them yourself. If you don\u2019t want to have to send in new photos, don\u2019t take them yourself. If you have to take them yourself, don\u2019t use a front-facing camera, as this actually flips the image, making it difficult for the dental professional to determine which side of your mouth they are seeing.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Don\u2019t take your photos from far away.<\/h2>\n<p>Your smile should take up the full frame when taking your picture (and not be cause you cropped the photo after you took it). We need to see your teeth up close and personal, so get close to that camera lens! If your whole head (or even more than your whole head) is in the photo, then you need to try again.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Capture all of your teeth, even the back ones.<\/h2>\n<p>If the dental professional reviewing your case can\u2019t see your molars (the very last teeth in your mouth), they can\u2019t assess your smile. This goes for all photos\u2014whether your mouth is open or your teeth are closed, and you\u2019re pulling your lips back to capture the sides of your teeth. Make sure you aren\u2019t covering up any of your teeth (molars included) with your fingers or lips! Use the handy smile stretcher tool including in your impression kit to ensure your entire smile is visible!<\/p>\n<h2>5. Bite down on your back teeth, not your front teeth.<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the photos require you to bite down. For these images, you should be biting down on your molars to show your natural bite. Don\u2019t bite so that your front teeth line up directly with your bottom teeth. This type of posturing forward doesn\u2019t showcase your actual bite, and these photos will be rejected.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Use bright light, but not too bright.<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s best to take your photos in a brightly lit room, but don\u2019t stand directly in front of the light source. If the light is behind your head, it distorts the image, making your teeth difficult to see. We also don\u2019t want to see light reflected off your teeth. If you use a flash, and it\u2019s causing reflections or making your teeth shine, turn it off.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Don\u2019t take photos without cleaning your teeth.<\/h2>\n<p>Brush and floss before you take your photos. If your teeth aren\u2019t clean, it makes it difficult to clearly see and assess your smile. If you don\u2019t floss often, you\u2019ll want to rinse your mouth with warm salt water for 30 seconds after you floss, before you take your photos.<\/p>\n<h2>Get started on your new smile today!<\/h2>\n<p>If you want a beautiful smile for up to 60% less than the cost of braces, then SmileDirectClub could be right for you!
