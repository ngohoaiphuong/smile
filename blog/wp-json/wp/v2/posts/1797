We create BPA-free clear plastic trays that fit snugly over teeth to gradually shift them into the desired position. SmileDirectClub aligner therapy includes several sets of custom-made aligners, worn for 1 to 2 weeks at a time to straighten your smile. This process takes, on average, 4-6 months. Each aligner will make slight adjustments to tooth position, advancing you to the next stage of your new smile. The process is mapped out in advance, and a SmileDirectClub affiliated, state licensed <a href=\"\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\">dentist or orthodontist<\/a> oversees each case.<\/p>\n<h3>When are clear aligners better than braces?<\/h3>\n<p>We work with 250+ state licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/meet-your-dentist-smiledirectclub-q-dr-sulitzer\/\">dentists and orthodontists<\/a> utilizing SmileDirectClub&#8217;s teledentistry platform. Your treating doctor prescribes your smile plan, oversees your case, and will schedule regular virtual check-ins with you. By removing monthly in-office visits, we pass thousands of dollars in savings directly on to you. We work with many <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/insurance\">insurance providers<\/a> directly and we also accept HSA, FSA, and CareCredit.<\/p>\n<p>Braces typically correct more severe issues, whereas aligners work best for those with mild to moderate crowding, spacing, and general alignment concerns.<\/p>\n<h3>Where do I start?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re at least 12 years old and have all of your permanent teeth, then you could be a candidate for SmileDirectClub.
