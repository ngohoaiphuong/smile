This dairy product can help prevent cavities,\u00a0according to a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2013-06\/aogd-nrs060513.php\">study<\/a>\u00a0published in\u00a0<i>General Dentistry<\/i>.\u00a0The researchers looked at the effect of milk, cheese, and\u00a0sugar-free yogurt on the participants&#8217; dental plaque\u00a0pH.\u00a0The higher the pH level is above 5.5, the lower the risk of developing cavities.
