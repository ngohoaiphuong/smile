This means your plan may need to be updated during your treatment or additional aligners may be provided after. There are many reasons why a Club member may need an aligner touch-up, but no matter the reason, we\u2019re always here to help. Here are some tips to reduce the chance of needing a Touch-up:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Stick to your prescription.<\/h2>\n<p>Your wear schedule is determined by the doctor overseeing your case, and the doctor definitely knows best. Do not skip to a new set early, and be sure you\u2019re wearing them for 22 hours a day (or 10 continuous hours if you\u2019re using Nighttime Aligners\u2122). If you ever get off track, you can give us a call and we can help.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Maintain good dental hygiene.<\/h2>\n<p>Brush after meals and snacks \u2013 and always before putting your aligners back in your mouth. Experts also recommend flossing daily. Feel free to use a clear or whitening mouthwash as directed to freshen your breath and help clean hard-to-reach spaces between your teeth.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Clean your aligners.<\/h2>\n<p>Whenever you remove your aligners, try rinsing them with cold water to help prevent saliva from building up on the plastic. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t use hot or boiling water to clean them! Doing so can warp and ruin your aligners. You can use our <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.smiledirectclub.com\/products\/universal-cleaning-tablets\">Universal Cleaning Tablets<\/a> to keep them clean or check out some more tips on how to <a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/5-easy-ways-clean-your-aligners\/\">clean aligners.<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>4. Bring your case with you on the go.<\/h2>\n<p>Misplacing an aligner isn\u2019t the end of the world, but if you lose one away from home, you may also lose some of the progress you\u2019ve made. If you\u2019re forgetful, you can order our <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.smiledirectclub.com\/products\/tile-case\">aligner case with Tile\u2122 built-in Bluetooth finding technology<\/a>, so you\u2019ll always know where your aligners are.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Register your aligners.<\/h2>\n<p>When you receive your aligners, register them online to ensure that you get notifications that remind you to switch aligners.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Continue regular dental checkups.<\/h2>\n<p>Unless you&#8217;re at a high risk of cavities or gum disease, experts typically recommend you see a dentist once or twice a year. Dental checkups are an excellent way to check for issues you may not even know are there yet. Once you start wearing aligners, continue visiting your local dentist throughout your smile journey. They can still complete your regular dental cleanings and, if necessary, other treatments that arise.<\/p>\n<h2>7.
