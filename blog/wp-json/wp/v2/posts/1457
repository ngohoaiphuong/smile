Cover your laugh,'&#8221; Amy says. &#8220;Even on my wedding day. I shouldn\u2019t have been thinking, &#8216;Don&#8217;t smile so big.&#8217; But that voice was trying to remind me not to smile.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After years of listening to that voice and hiding her smile, Amy, now 26, decided to do something about it. She began her <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmileDirectClub<\/a> journey in June 2017, and today her straight, bright smile has given her a whole new outlook and zest for life.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy confidence is through the roof,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m finally able to smile and laugh the way I feel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2280\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-clear-aligners-confidence.png\" alt=\"amy smile direct club clear aligners confidence\" width=\"788\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-clear-aligners-confidence.png 788w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-clear-aligners-confidence-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-clear-aligners-confidence-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;I was embarrassed of my teeth.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>After having braces twice growing up, Amy found that her teeth kept shifting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My very lovely parents gave me braces, and I did at one point have straight teeth,&#8221; Amy says. &#8220;That didn&#8217;t last long at all. I never wore my retainer. My teeth shifted a little, and then they kept shifting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Amy graduated from Samford University in 2015 and got a job in marketing and advertising in Birmingham, Alabama. She and her husband, Ethan, got married the following year, and life was going well. Except her teeth still bothered her.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a young professional and consider myself an independent woman,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I was very embarrassed of my teeth. I would wake up in the morning and my first thought would be, &#8216;Oh, my teeth.'&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>She\u2019d scour Facebook to untag any photos showing her teeth and would even cover her laugh when around others. Ultimately, she adopted what she calls an &#8220;awkward, fake closed-mouth smile&#8221; for a long time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2283\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-after-photo.png\" alt=\"amy smile direct club invisible aligners after photo\" width=\"788\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-after-photo.png 788w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-after-photo-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-after-photo-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Time for a change<\/h3>\n<p>When Ethan\u2019s job moved the couple to Shreveport, Louisiana, in the summer of 2017, she started selling more of her unique and fun paper crafts, including custom invitations and pi\u00f1atas. The couple knew they\u2019d have a year in Louisiana, and Amy decided she wanted to do something for herself in that time. What would mean the most to her was to straighten her teeth.<\/p>\n<p>After meeting with her local orthodontist to discuss <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/can-you-straighten-your-teeth-without-braces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teeth straightening options<\/a>, Amy was quoted $5500 for aligners, plus a treatment plan that would take 15 months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was so upset because I wanted a solution, and I felt like that was not a good use of my money right now in life,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<p>A friend told Amy about SmileDirectClub, and she almost thought it was too good to be true. (Spoiler: It&#8217;s not.) Amy went into a SmileShop for a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/smile-direct-club-3d-scan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free 3D scan<\/a>; a few days later, she received her <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">3D smile plan<\/a> and was able to see how her teeth would change month by month with SmileDirectClub invisible aligners. In just 7 months \u2013 less than half the time her orthodontist quoted her \u2013 the aligners would address her crowding issues and help generally straighten her teeth. And she\u2019d be able to use her Etsy shop earnings to do so.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;My aunt is a dental hygienist, so I called her before I did SmileDirectClub,&#8221; Amy says. &#8220;My aunt talked to the dentist she works with and looked into it. She said there was no reason not to move forward.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Although SmileDirectClub can be done completely remotely via <a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/covid-19-shines-a-spotlight-on-telehealth-what-it-is-and-how-it-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teledentistry<\/a>, every member is assigned a licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dentist or orthodontist<\/a> who oversees their new smile from start to finish and checks in every 90 days to make sure everything is shifting according to plan. Every Club member can rest assured they\u2019ll have a doctor\u2019s guidance each step of the way.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2281\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-confidence.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"788\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-confidence.png 788w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-confidence-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-confidence-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>&#8220;I smile big now.&#8221;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Everyone in Amy&#8217;s life supported her through her smile transformation. She sent weekly updates to her friends and shared a countdown calendar. They all texted her to congratulate her on her last day wearing her aligners.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I smile big now,&#8221; Amy says with a wide grin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t cover my mouth. I\u2019m excited to smile!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Shortly after finishing her smile journey, Amy and her husband moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to be closer to family and got an Australian Shepherd, Louis. Amy and Louis take <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/take-an-instagram-worthy-after-selfie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">selfies<\/a> together every morning \u2013 she&#8217;s no longer afraid to show off her teeth.<\/p>\n<p>The lift in confidence from SmileDirectClub has impacted Amy\u2019s life in ways she never expected.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, Amy loved her new smile so much that she began working for SmileDirectClub \u2013 a job she never would have considered prior to having aligners. Today, Amy wears her signature quirky earrings all the time, never worried about drawing more attention to her face. She\u2019s happy to talk to people up close without any fear of them seeing her teeth. And her bright, bubbly personality finally shines through her smile.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2282\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-results.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"788\" height=\"525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-results.png 788w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-results-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/amy-smile-direct-club-invisible-aligners-results-768x512.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>She\u2019s investing in herself creatively this year, too, enrolling in a sewing class and baking class, and using her die-cut machine at home for her made-to-order cards, invitations, and pi\u00f1atas.
