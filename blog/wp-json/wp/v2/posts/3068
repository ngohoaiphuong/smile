Nobody ever said anything about them, but it was a thing to me. Every time I smiled in pictures or looked in the mirror, it was an issue for me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3070\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-2-1.png\" alt=\"Ralph Walner: before and after SmileDirectClub aligners\" width=\"574\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-2-1.png 853w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-2-1-300x202.png 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-2-1-768x518.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ralph lives in Houston and is an energy consultant, working with commercial buildings and national chains, managing utility contracts, and tracking building-wide energy consumption.<\/p>\n<p>That professional environment, he says, also contributed to his swelling waistline. A few too many drinks out with colleagues, and lunches ordered in, and he estimates the scale hit 215 pounds instead of his svelte college weight around 175.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t focusing on myself, I was just focusing on my career. I looked in the mirror one day and I just wasn&#8217;t happy,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a shallow person, but toward myself I was being super shallow \u2014 &#8216;you shouldn&#8217;t dress like that because you don&#8217;t look fly.&#8217; It was a mental thing for me. If I lose the weight and fix my smile maybe I will be fly,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-3074\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-7-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Ralph flashes his new smile inside the gym.\" width=\"371\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-7-scaled.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-7-225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-7-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-7-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame-7-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" \/>His teeth were particularly important to him because as a child, <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/pricing\/\">his family couldn&#8217;t afford braces for him<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I grew up, I paid off my debts, I&#8217;m going to treat myself to SmileDirectClub,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The aligners that SmileDirectClub sent helped not just his teeth, but his weight loss efforts, too. Since the aligners need to be removed before a meal, and then washed before returning to their place, Walner had to plan out his eating schedule more carefully, which lead to planning his meals better, too. He also started running, returning to his high school passion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While I was doing SmileDirectClub, I was trying to get back to fitness and being healthy,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I lost about 40 pounds while I was also getting my teeth right. Honestly, I look like a different person.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Today, he runs four to eight miles a day around central Houston and plans meals at least four days a week. He&#8217;s had his clothes tailored so they fit him perfectly, and he walks into those commercial buildings, smiling.<\/p>\n<h2>The Khloe Kardashian Effect<\/h2>\n<p>In 2018, Khloe Kardashian, one of the sisters in the famous celebrity family, announced that she had shed 60 pounds after giving birth to a child. Raquel Pryor isn&#8217;t a Kardashian devote, but found her inspiration: If Khloe Kardashian could drop the weight, so could she.<\/p>\n<p>Pryor, a bookkeeper in the Bay Area of California, has two children, ages 1 and 5. She&#8217;s always been self-conscious about her smile, even if her friends and family told her they didn&#8217;t see any issues. And then there was her weight.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3071\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Before.png\" alt=\"Raquel shows off her weight loss and smile transformation after SmileDirectClub aligners\" width=\"638\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Before.png 1185w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Before-269x300.png 269w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Before-916x1024.png 916w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Before-768x858.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For most of my adult life was overweight, and once you&#8217;re dealing with a bigger problem like weight \u2014 why would I fix my smile or my hair if I&#8217;m over 300 pounds,&#8221; she says. Raquel dreamed of being blonde. Once she started dropping weight, she finally took the plunge \u2014 and ordered her <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/how_it_works\/\">SmileDirectClub aligners<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by Kardashian, and just like Ralph, Raquel started focusing on exercise and diet, joining programs that helped her track both. She realized she couldn&#8217;t work out in the house \u2014 her older child would climb all over her, and render her workout secondary. She needed to find space and time alone, which meant leaving the house. She started running.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;Running is the worst thing ever when you&#8217;re 300 pounds,&#8221; due to the pounding on your body, she says. &#8220;It hurts.&#8221; But, she says, laughing, \u201cI didn&#8217;t say you had to like it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>She just had to keep with it. She saw it not as an option, but a habit, a daily must-do. As she racked up the miles, her body, and her perspective, changed.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-3075\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame6.png\" alt=\"Raquel after SmileDirectClub aligners\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame6.png 1196w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame6-240x300.png 240w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame6-821x1024.png 821w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Frame6-768x958.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I love running now, but it&#8217;s taken three, four years to get there,&#8221; she acknowledges.
