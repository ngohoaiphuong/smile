You&#8217;ll have special financing options available that you wouldn&#8217;t with a regular credit card.<\/p>\n<h2>Who&#8217;s it for?<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone 18 and older. You will need to <a href=\"http:\/\/carecredit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">apply online or by phone<\/a>, with instant approval and no activation fee. To complete your application, you will need to provide your doctor&#8217;s name or how you plan to use it. You&#8217;ll also need to share your Social Security number or ITIN, net income, and housing information.<\/p>\n<h2>How does it work?<\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll purchase your aligners up front with your CareCredit card. Then you&#8217;ll make easy monthly payments to CareCredit to take care of the balance.<\/p>\n<p>There are a variety of plans to choose from, including 6- or 12-month interest-free payment plans. For more information, give us a call directly or visit <a href=\"http:\/\/carecredit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CareCredit.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you have CareCredit but not enough available credit to cover the full cost of aligners, you can still use the card. Apply your CareCredit balance as a down payment to purchase your aligners. We&#8217;ll divide the remaining difference into 24 equal monthly payments on a different card.<\/p>\n<h2>Does the credit expire?<\/h2>\n<p>Nope! Provided you&#8217;re in good standing and have available credit, you can use CareCredit like any other card where accepted. According to their website, make sure to use your card at least once a year to maintain an active account status.<\/p>\n<p><i>Ready to get a smile you&#8217;ll love?
