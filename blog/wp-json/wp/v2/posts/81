Dental research shows that straighter teeth are actually healthier teeth.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about\u00a0straightening your smile, consider these added health benefits of straight teeth.<\/p>\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" class=\"btn btn--purple\">\r\n\t\t\tAre you a candidate for invisible aligners?\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t\n<h3>What are the health benefits of straight teeth?<\/h3>\n<h3>1. Easy cleaning<\/h3>\n<h3>2. Healthier teeth<\/h3>\n<h3>3. Healthier gums<\/h3>\n<h3>4. Less wear and tear<\/h3>\n<h3>5. Improved speech<\/h3>\n<h3>6. Improved overall health<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>1. Easy cleaning<\/h3>\n<p>Crowded teeth may make flossing frustrating due to the lack of space between your teeth, which can make it hard to get the floss into all the nooks and crannies. Many people who&#8217;ve straightened their teeth with invisible aligners find it much easier to floss within just the few first weeks of wearing their aligners. And if it&#8217;s easier to floss, you&#8217;re more likely to keep up with it.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Healthier teeth<\/h3>\n<p>Clean teeth are healthier teeth. Trapped food in your teeth can lead to plaque, which increases the risk of cavities and tooth decay \u2013 both of which can mean costly dental work. Not only will aligners straighten your smile to help avoid that, but you&#8217;ll also be be brushing and flossing after every meal or snack.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Healthier gums<\/h3>\n<p>In many cases, red and swollen gums are a direct result of teeth that are too widely spaced or too crowded, which can be minimized by straightening your smile. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nih.gov\/news-events\/nih-research-matters\/immune-culprits-linked-inflammation-bone-loss-gum-disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research reported by the NIH<\/a> has shown a link between periodontal disease and the loss of bone and teeth. And a lot of other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nidcr.nih.gov\/health-info\/gum-disease\/more-info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bad stuff<\/a>.\u00a0Having straighter teeth helps your gums fit around your teeth better, reducing your risk of developing gum disease.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Less wear and tear<\/h3>\n<p>Your teeth do a lot of work. Every time you bite down, they&#8217;re sustaining pressure. That extra pressure can cause your teeth to wear down sooner than they should\u00a0\u2013 plus other scary stuff like possible gum recession, poor support at the roots, and loose teeth. It can also cause shoulder pain, neck pain, headaches, or muscle pain in the temples where the jaws meet near the ears.\u00a0 Straightening your smile now can prevent you a lot of headaches down the road.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Improved speech<\/h3>\n<p>As a key part of your mouth, your teeth play an important role in your speech. Gapped, protruding, or crowded teeth can affect your speaking patterns. Straightening your smile can help.
