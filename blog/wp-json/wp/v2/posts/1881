The photos that <a href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/bodies\/dad-of-washington-teen-striking-a-pose-to-mimic-her-provocative-selfies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">went viral<\/a> a few years ago when dad <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/therealburrmartin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burr Martin<\/a> started re-creating his daughter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cassiehorror\/\">Cassie<\/a>\u2019s selfies and sharing them on social media?<\/p>\n<p>Burr copied Cassie\u2019s selfies down to the outfits, tattoos, poses, piercings, and more, spending hours penning the tattoos to get the perfect shot \u2013 all in an effort to scare off the boys who were commenting on her pics.<\/p>\n<p>More than 200,000 followers and thousands on thousands of Instagram likes later, the famous #SelfieDad and daughter duo are still smiling \u2013 with a little help from <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmileDirectClub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1889 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/smiledirectclub-selfie-dad.gif\" alt=\"smiledirectclub selfie dad and daughter\" width=\"788\" height=\"530\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What the world didn\u2019t notice about Cassie was that she never actually showed her smile in her selfies. Her dad didn&#8217;t notice it either. Until one day when Cassie came home from work and told him about how she overheard a group of girls making fun of her smile. Burr had seen SmileDirectClub ads and decided to give Cassie the gift of a smile she could be proud of.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt that point, I didn\u2019t have a choice. You can\u2019t hear, \u2018Oh, look at her teeth\u2019 and not do something,\u201d Burr says.

Okay, done. It was very easy.\u201d<\/p>\n<h4><strong>It\u2019s easy.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>After deciding on SmileDirectClub, Burr went online and ordered Cassie an <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impression kit<\/a>, which she did right in her own bathroom \u2013 no dentist visit necessary. Cassie says,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt was super simple.

Like, oh my gosh, she\u2019s really smiling with her teeth. It brought a lot of confidence back to her, which was a huge deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNow I can wear lipstick again,\u201d Cassie says. \u201cI never used to wear lipstick because I didn\u2019t want to draw attention toward my mouth, but now I wear bright red lipstick and I feel super confident in it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s even better than rocking bright red lipstick? Laughing without thinking what you look like doing it.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis tooth was so bad that I would be afraid of laughing,\u201d Cassie says, pointing to her smile and showing how she used to cover her mouth every time she laughed.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNow I can throw my head back and laugh and don\u2019t feel super insecure, which is nice.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1885 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/smile-direct-club-cassie.jpg\" alt=\"smiledirectclub selfie dad cassie\" width=\"788\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/smile-direct-club-cassie.jpg 788w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/smile-direct-club-cassie-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/smile-direct-club-cassie-768x493.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Cassie wasn\u2019t the only one who felt good after finishing her smile plan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI felt really good about it because I did something right, and that was great because that doesn\u2019t happen a lot,\u201d Burr says.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cShe was famous for her selfies and smiling, but it wasn\u2019t really a smile that it should\u2019ve been.
