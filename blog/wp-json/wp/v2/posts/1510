In fact, SmileDirectClub helps straighten the teeth of those as young as 12 years old. Aligners\u00a0are custom-made and designed to shift teeth into a straighter smile you\u2019ll love. And they might be an ideal fit for you and your lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\">\t<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" class=\"btn btn--purple\">\r\n\t\t\tSee if you&#8217;re a candidate\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are aligners?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Aligners are custom-made, thin plastic coverings or \u201ctrays\u201d that fit snugly over your teeth. Their design allows for healthy alignment and looks aesthetically pleasing. If you qualify for SmileDirectClub\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\">doctor-directed<\/a>, clear aligner therapy, you will be sent a series of these <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/what-happens-after-you-complete-a-scan-or-impression-kit\/\">aligners<\/a> directly to your home.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll wear each set of aligners for 1\u20132 weeks, as your doctor prescribes, to shift your teeth slightly. Then you&#8217;ll go on to the next set, which will continue to move them further. Over time, all the small movements will add up to a big change!

One of the most flexible for your active lifestyle is SmileDirectClub\u2019s aligners. And if you\u2019re a teen or the parent of a teen, SmileDirectClub\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\">doctor-directed<\/a>, doctor-prescribed, <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/6-things-parents-know-teen-braces-smile-direct-club\/\">aligners<\/a> may be a perfect solution!<\/p>\n<p>There are two differentiating features of aligners. The first is that they are clear, which means they are very difficult to detect when you are wearing them. The second is that you can take them out when eating or drinking, and most importantly you can take them out to <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/6-tips-your-biggest-dental-hygiene-questions\">floss and brush your teeth<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How are aligners different from braces?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/whats-difference-between-smiledirectclub-and-braces\/\">Traditional metal braces<\/a> still work best in some situations \u2013 and you might be surprised to find that they&#8217;re still a popular option for many teenagers needing more complex tooth movement! But now that aligners are being designed specifically for teens, more are choosing them every day.<\/p>\n<p>Your aligners are designed to be worn all day and night except when eating and drinking anything other than water. You\u2019re able to take them out for meals or important social occasions. Yet even when you&#8217;re wearing them, it&#8217;s pretty hard for anyone else to tell \u2013 a big difference from metal braces.<\/p>\n<p>Aligners make your teeth easier to clean than braces. Because they&#8217;re removable, there&#8217;s nothing to keep you from brushing and flossing everywhere in your mouth, just as you would normally. But brushing and flossing can be much harder to do around the brackets and wires of braces \u2013 and oral hygiene often suffers.<\/p>\n<p>Some people also suffer irritation to the cheeks and gums from the metal parts of braces. Fortunately, the plastic of an aligner rarely causes that kind of problem. Plus, you won&#8217;t have to rush into the dental office to quickly fix a protruding wire or reattach a broken bracket. You won&#8217;t have to watch what you eat, either, because you&#8217;ll simply remove the aligners at mealtimes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Ready to try SmileDirectClub?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a teenager and you would like to improve your smile, consider SmileDirectClub\u2019s aligners as an option. You&#8217;ll love the way your new smile looks. And straight teeth will make it easier for you to keep your teeth clean and improve your oral health!<\/p>\n<p><em>See if you\u2019re a candidate for SmileDirectClub by taking our free, 30-second Smile Assessment below.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\">\t<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" class=\"btn btn--purple\">\r\n\t\t\tGet Started\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hint: They&#8217;re big fans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":20,"featured_media":1511,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[886,888],"tags":[15,341,16,23,252,494,17,18,495,496,493],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1510"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/20"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1510"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1510\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1511"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1510"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1510"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1510"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
