As part of the custom program, dental professionals evaluate the customer\u2019s smile to create a treatment plan to gradually shift their teeth to the desired position. SmileDirectClub doesn&#8217;t require regular in-office visits.<\/p>\n<p>Customers get a 3D image of their teeth at a <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/locations\/\">SmileShop<\/a>, or create molds of their teeth using an <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/how_it_works\/\">impression kit<\/a>. They receive all their custom SmileDirectClub aligners shipped at-once. Customers then follow along with their personalized online portal or within the app. Each customer is assigned a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\">state-licensed dentist or orthodontist<\/a>, who conducts regular virtual check-ins to make sure teeth are moving as planned.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How it works<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>\u201cTara needed to have her upper central incisors moved out a bit to meet her lateral incisors for a better aesthetic appearance. We also needed to make more space for her crowded lower front teeth,\u201d says\u00a0SmileDirectClub\u2019s lead dentist, Jeffrey\u00a0Sulitzer, DMD. \u201cThe invisible aligners effectively treated Tara\u2019s orthodontic needs, as she required mild tooth movement to obtain her desired aesthetic outcome. Tara also had the ability to remove her aligners before eating and while conducting her\u00a0daily oral hygiene.\u201d<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There wasn\u2019t a SmileShop in my area, so I used the at-home kit,\u201d says Tara.<\/p>\n<h2>Straight teeth in only 4 months<\/h2>\n<p>Tara\u2019s smile plan was 4 months in length.\u00a0\u201cShe wore three sets of aligners per month \u2013 one set for the first week, the second set for the next week, and the third set for the last two weeks. In total, we prescribed 12 aligners to bring Tara&#8217;s teeth into alignment,\u201d explains Dr.\u00a0Sulitzer. \u201cSmileDirectClub\u00a0customers utilize their accounts on the\u00a0SmileDirectClub\u00a0website to track which aligners they should be wearing, when they should be switching to the next set of aligners and how many weeks remain in their smile plans.\u201d<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt took some getting used to,\u201d Tara admits. \u201cI always made sure to change out my retainers on Friday evenings, so I could adjust over the weekend. <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/do-invisible-aligners-hurt\/\">Some of the trays hurt at first<\/a>, but the\u00a0pain usually went away by the next week. I work in customer service and I spend a lot of time on the phone, so I was concerned I would sound different.
