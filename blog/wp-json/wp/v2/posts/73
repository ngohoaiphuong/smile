Or maybe you\u2019ve taken the <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\">first step<\/a> to determine if SmileDirectClub\u2019s aligners are right for you and you\u2019re asking yourself, <em>now what<\/em>? With the help of our state-licensed dentists and orthodontists, we\u2019re here to explain the process and some of the benefits of teledentistry. So you can sleep, and smile, easy.<\/p>\n<h2>How a doctor monitors your new smile.<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019ve completed your remote <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/how-make-good-first-impression\">impression kit<\/a> or you&#8217;ve gone\u00a0to a <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/locations\/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=ELP&amp;utm_content=ELP\/\">SmileShop<\/a> for a 3D image, the basic process for making your new smile is the same for everyone. SmileDirectClub\u2019s aligners are offered through a network of over 250 state-licensed dentists and orthodontists. These doctors have many years of aligner therapy experience. Each SmileDirectClub customer is assigned a dentist or orthodontist who is licensed where they live.<\/p>\n<p>Your provider will assess your individual case, including your medical and dental history, and determine if SmileDirectClub aligners are the right fit for you. Then you&#8217;ll receive a 3D image of your new smile generated from your impressions or scan. We&#8217;ll create your individualized smile plan, ship your aligners, and remotely follow your progress all the way through the end of your smile journey. Your doctor will oversee your new smile, and schedule regular virtual check-ins with you.<\/p>\n<h2>Who are the dentists?<\/h2>\n<p>A Clinical Advisory Board guides SmileDirectClub&#8217;s network of dentists and orthodontists. In fact, the dentists and orthodontists in our network don&#8217;t work for SmileDirectClub at all. They can prescribe aligners to their customers, but they&#8217;re under no obligation to recommend SmileDirectClub&#8217;s aligners specifically.<\/p>\n<p>The Clinical Advisory Board is responsible for the establishment of recommended clinical guidelines and best practices for SmileDirectClub aligners. The board makes recommendations to SmileDirectClub on its practices and services.<\/p>\n<h2>Why teledentistry?<\/h2>\n<p>Teledentistry is a more convenient and accessible option for most people. It also offers doctors the ability to provide more affordable options for orthodontic treatment. That\u2019s why SmileDirectClub invisible aligners cost\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/pricing\">up to 60% less<\/a> than traditional braces and other teeth straightening options.\u00a0SmileDirectClub is a leader in promoting and developing advanced technology. We&#8217;ve also made it available to local orthodontists and general dentists while improving everyone\u2019s access to care.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We define quality as the intersection of customer satisfaction and the Standards of Care. Our affiliated network will always do their absolute best to make customers happy with the results of their smile. We utilize the Standards of Care established by the dental professional community,\u201d says Dr. Sulitzer.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>SmileDirectClub truly believes everyone deserves a smile they\u2019ll love. We are proud to be pioneers in the teledentistry space. We, along with dentists and orthodontists, are helping increase access to individuals who thought straight teeth weren\u2019t an option.<\/p>\n<p><i>Ready to get a smile you&#8217;ll love?
