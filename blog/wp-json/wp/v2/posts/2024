Not only did I not think I deserved my relationships or accomplishments, but I also never believed I could even make those things happen for myself. Let me explain: When I was in the third grade, my parents told me that they were getting divorced. I know that their divorce wasn\u2019t about me, but I still mark it as the first time I felt my confidence waver. I always thought they were totally fine, and the fact that I had missed whatever warning signs made me completely unsure of myself.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2027\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/tiffany-zubal-smile-direct-club-after.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"788\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/tiffany-zubal-smile-direct-club-after.jpeg 640w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/tiffany-zubal-smile-direct-club-after-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t get much easier as I got older. When I started high school, I was super reserved and lived in constant fear of judgment. No matter what I said or did, I was afraid it would be wrong. After a few years of this, I decided to apply for an independent study \u2013 thinking it would help me perform better in school\u00a0\u2013 and I ended up finishing high school from home. I graduated a year early, which was great and all, but I still wonder whether I made the right choice. From time to time, I see people who I was acquaintances with in high school, and it reminds me that I don\u2019t really have any friends from that time. On the other hand, being alone forced me to learn to be with\u00a0\u2013 and become good friends with\u00a0\u2013 myself.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m 22 years old now. I\u2019ve been married for three years, and my husband and I have a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter named Adeline. A lot of women say their confidence wavers after becoming a parent\u00a0\u2013 I guess they feel that, in a way, they lose a sense of themselves\u00a0\u2013 but for me, it\u2019s been quite the opposite. As soon as I got pregnant with Adeline, I knew that I didn\u2019t want her to feel the way I had felt about myself almost my whole life. I didn\u2019t want her to think,\u00a0<em>I can\u2019t do that because I\u2019m not smart enough,\u00a0<\/em>or\u00a0<em>I can\u2019t do that because I don\u2019t have friends<\/em>. In short: I didn\u2019t want what held me back to hold her back, so I gave myself no choice but to go after what I wanted and to be happy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s important to me that she sees me as a confident woman<\/strong>, so I became very careful not to speak negatively about myself or perpetuate the idea that I wasn&#8217;t good enough. I want her to always know that if you want to do something, you just have to believe in yourself and do it, because otherwise, it\u2019s not going to happen. People can\u2019t do that for you. You have to do it for yourself.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2025 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Tiffany-before-and-after.jpg\" alt=\"tiffany before after smile direct club review\" width=\"788\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Tiffany-before-and-after.jpg 788w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Tiffany-before-and-after-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Tiffany-before-and-after-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Tiffany-before-and-after-768x770.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To be that strong, confident woman for my daughter, one major thing I had to overcome was my fear of showing people my <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/can-you-straighten-your-teeth-without-braces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">teeth<\/a>. I really tried not to open my mouth much, so I either kept quiet or looked down when I spoke\u00a0\u2013 rarely making eye contact. I know it was probably in my head, but I felt like everybody\u2019s eyes went straight to my teeth. So when I saw a social media ad for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmileDirectClub aligners<\/a>, I immediately started to figure out how we could swing it. <strong>From start to finish, my teeth were straight in just four months.<\/strong> Now, I\u2019ve started making eye contact when I talk to people\u00a0\u2013 whether that be to prospective friends, clients at the kids&#8217; hair salon where I\u2019m a manager, or store owners I approach to sell\u00a0Adeline\u2019s Bow Line, my collection of children&#8217;s clothes and accessories. I don\u2019t know whether it was my\u00a0confidence\u00a0coming through or what, but I was able to access my inner positive voices instead of just the negative ones.<\/p>\n<p>Turns out, putting yourself down takes up a lot of brain space, and that limits the room to actually act on your hopes and dreams. It took away the power to go after what I want. When I thought I couldn\u2019t do certain things, I figured there was no reason to try. But when I put myself in the positive mindset of believing that I can, it&#8217;s so much easier to throw caution to the wind and just go for it.<\/p>\n<p>I used to wonder,<em>\u00a0If I post this\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/take-an-instagram-worthy-after-selfie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-tracker-added=\"true\">selfie<\/a>, is everybody going to think I\u2019m obsessed with myself?\u00a0<\/em>But no, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m allowed to like myself.<strong> It\u2019s good to be humble, but no one should frown upon people being confident in themselves.<\/strong> Celebrating myself and my success doesn\u2019t mean I have some sort of perfect life. I just know that even if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re enough, it\u2019s worth acting like you are because eventually, you\u2019ll believe it.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.refinery29.com\/en-us\/teeth-aligners-personal-experience-confidence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This story originally appeared on Refinery29.com.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Straightening her smile helped Tiffany finally gain lifelong confidence. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":20,"featured_media":2029,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[889,891],"tags":[42,387,45,189,691,692,17,697,384,696,693,695,694,573,385],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2024"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/20"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2024"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2024\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2029"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2024"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2024"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2024"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
