In late April, her daughter discovered the &#8220;ball.&#8221; On a Sunday night, she called her doctor. By that Friday, she had had a mammogram and was scheduled for a biopsy.<\/p>\n<p>In less than a month, she had a 12-week chemo schedule. She was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive type that can be hard to treat and is more likely to be found in younger women, under age 55, than other types of breast cancer, according to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breastcancer.org\/symptoms\/diagnosis\/trip_neg\">Breastcancer.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Her prognosis may be better than others with this type of cancer because it was found so early. Thanks to regular self-checkups, she knew the lump her daughter found was new. Because of the pandemic, few patients were coming in for checkups or mammograms, so she was able to book tests and start treatment immediately, she says.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2976\" src=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.47.29-PM-202x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"385\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.47.29-PM-202x300.png 202w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.47.29-PM.png 618w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Around that time, her aligners arrived in the mail.<\/p>\n<p>She began to second-guess her decision to prioritize straightening her teeth during such a stressful time\u2014she wondered if she could keep her job or if the medical bills would pile up. But her husband encouraged her to stick with it, and she agreed.<\/p>\n<h2>Treatment Begins<\/h2>\n<p>In her job as an in-home nurse, Shauna cares for a paraplegic boy who survived a brain tumor at age three. He is wheelchair-bound and needs help breathing and eating. He attended school in the same building as her own son\u2014their classrooms were next door before the pandemic shut down.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I want to be that type of cancer survivor,&#8221; she says of his resilience. And so she keeps working, at least 60 hours a week.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>But the chemo has taken a physical toll. The weekly treatments shifted to once every three weeks in September. The chemicals build up in the body, so by fall, the treatments made her nauseous. She had to remove her aligners with four weeks left in her SmileDirectClub treatment plan because she was throwing up so often.<\/p>\n<p>In November comes an MRI and checkups to see if the treatments worked, or if the cancer spread. She&#8217;ll face a decision on whether to have a double mastectomy.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2975\" src=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.44.55-PM-202x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"495\" height=\"735\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.44.55-PM-202x300.png 202w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.44.55-PM-691x1024.png 691w, https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-2.44.55-PM.png 726w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But since chemo ends in a few weeks, she&#8217;s already had a treatment update with SmileDirectClub and has new aligners on order.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I never thought teeth were that big of a deal, but they are that big of a deal when you don&#8217;t have hair,&#8221; she says.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I&#8217;m still in the process of my smile and chemotherapy.
