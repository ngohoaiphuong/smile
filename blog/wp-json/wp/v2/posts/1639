Our customers get a straighter smile in as soon as 4-6 months. Each customer receives a 3D smile plan that shows how their teeth will move, month by month, when wearing SmileDirectClub aligners as directed. And as a member of the Club, if at the end of your plan you don&#8217;t love your smile, our SmileDirectClub warranty is here to help you out.<\/p>\n<h3>How does the Club Warranty work?<\/h3>\n<p>If at the end of your smile plan, you&#8217;ve followed the guidelines but haven\u2019t achieved your desired smile, contact us so your state-licensed dentist or orthodontist can look into a Touch-up. You could be eligible for Touch-up if you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wear your aligners as prescribed and only remove when eating or drinking anything other than cool water.<\/li>\n<li>Register your aligners.<\/li>\n<li>Respond to virtual check-ins from your doctor by sending an email with the requested photos.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your Touch-up is approved, you may be eligible for additional aligners to continue your smile journey.
