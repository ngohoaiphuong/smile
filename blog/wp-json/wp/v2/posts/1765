Make a good first impression.<\/h3>\n<p>First, we make a 3D image of your teeth to see exactly what&#8217;s going on and align your smile. There are 3 easy ways to make a 3D image: You can visit a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/what-is-smiledirectclub-smileshop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmileShop<\/a> for an image of your smile, you can visit a local dentist or orthodontist in our Partner Network, or we can build it from the impressions you take using our doctor-prescribed <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impression kit<\/a>. A treatment plan is made using this 3D image, which is reviewed, approved, and prescribed by a state licensed <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dentist or orthodontist.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>2. Straighten your teeth without traditional braces.<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll send you your entire treatment&#8217;s aligners directly to your door. Throughout treatment, you will have regular virtual check-ins with your doctor to monitor your progress.
