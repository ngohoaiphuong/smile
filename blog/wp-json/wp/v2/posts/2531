As soon as he was old enough, Gabriel looked into another solution, but he was quoted $5,000 for a two-and-a-half-year treatment plan with regular office visits, which didn\u2019t exactly work with his schedule.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would smile with my mouth closed, because I was afraid to show my teeth,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to showcase what I had, because when I looked at myself, I didn\u2019t like what I saw.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gabriel was gearing up to leave for college and knew he wanted to do something about his smile. And then he saw a commercial for SmileDirectClub.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAfter I started doing SmileDirectClub, everything changed.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Starting his smile journey<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Gabriel went in for a 3D scan at the 5th Avenue <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smileshops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmileShop<\/a> in New York City to get started with SmileDirectClub.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/what-is-smiledirectclub-smileshop\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coolest offices<\/a> I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was not like a dental office; it was a more laid-back and relaxed environment.

I saw results that very first week.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To stay motivated and make the most of his experience, Gabriel took advantage of everything SmileDirectClub had to offer. He went to all the New York City SmileShop events, from in-store massages to self-portrait latte art, and he read up on blog posts to find inspiration from other Club members\u2019 stories.<\/p>\n<p>This was just the start of his own journey to confidence.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy mind was set to transform myself, and I did it for me; to make myself happy,\u201d he says. \u201cI was hiding behind a shell for so many years, and now that I had the opportunity to do it, I was going to go for it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The weight loss journey<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As soon as Gabriel started seeing his smile shift, he says he was encouraged to do more.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was getting healthier, I was working out, and the more change I saw in my smile, the more change I wanted to do to my body,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an entire 180-degree transformation.
