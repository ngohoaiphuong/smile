While our <a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\/?w=impr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">impression kit<\/a> can be delivered to directly to your door, SmileShops give you the chance to learn about SmileDirectClub in person. You&#8217;ll have a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/smile-direct-club-3d-scan\/\">3D image<\/a> taken of your smile\u00a0that will then be used to create custom invisible aligners to straighten your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>New SmileShops are popping up across the world every month, and while you eagerly wait to get scanned in a city near you, let\u2019s take a look at what you can expect from a SmileShop!<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\t<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" class=\"btn btn--purple\">\r\n\t\t\tAm I a candidate?\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/373936173\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>Getting a 3D image<\/h2>\n<p>Our SmileShops are nothing like going to a dentist. The spaces are bright and comfortable. Our SmileGuides are friendly. No pain is involved, and there aren&#8217;t endless pages of forms to fill out.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/smileshops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Once you schedule your SmileShop visit<\/a>, we&#8217;ll send a few emails and texts leading up to your appointment that provide detailed directions and instructions to prepare you for your appointment. Once you arrive, you&#8217;ll meet our team, get a 3D image of your smile and photos taken by one of our friendly SmileGuides, and receive free whitening gel. During the appointment, our Smile Guide slowly passes a wand over each tooth, careful to record the contour of your teeth and gums. This camera takes 6000 photos per second that together create a 3D image of your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>You can actually see the shape of each of your teeth on the screen beside you as they\u2019re being recorded! The total appointment takes about 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Once your teeth have been scanned, the images of your mouth will be sent to the <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/doctors-behind-your-smile\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">state licensed dentist or orthodontist<\/a> who&#8217;s assigned to your case. Your SmilePlan will be created after this.<\/p>\n<h2>Impression kit vs. SmileShop<\/h2>\n<p>What is the difference between an impression kit and a SmileShop? This is one of our commonly asked questions.<\/p>\n<p>Both options will get you started toward your new smile. An impression kit allows you to make molds of your teeth that are used to create your treatment plan.<\/p>\n<p>The best part: You can make your impressions without leaving the comfort of your home! SmileDirectClub operates using a teledentistry model, which is a fancy way to say that we have state-licensed dentists and orthodontists working remotely to evaluate your smile and deliver quality care to you. You get to skip the tedious in-office visits (and the price of them). With clear instructions included in each kit on how to make and mail back your impressions, you can even start your new smile journey in your pjs if you want. You\u2019ll mail your impressions back to us, complete your photo assessment, and our team will use them to create your smile plan.<\/p>\n<p>Both the impression kit and SmileShop scan will help you get started on your new smile.<\/p>\n<h2>Payment options<\/h2>\n<p>Your SmileShop visit is completely free. Yes, really! Before you leave the SmileShop, you can complete a Fast Track form to pay for your invisible aligners. This gets your aligners to you in the fastest possible time frame. Choose Single Pay to make a one-time payment, or choose SmilePay\u2122, our convenient monthly financing option. No credit checks. No forms to fill out.<\/p>\n<p>For customers in the United States, SmileDirectClub is in network with UnitedHealthCare, Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire BlueCross BlueShield. Even if you don&#8217;t have coverage with one of these companies, many insurance providers offer reimbursement on your aligner treatment. Click <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/insurance\">here<\/a> to see if insurance will cover some of the cost of your new smile. We also accept <a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/dont-lose-your-fsa-dollars\/\">HSA, FSA<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/how-does-carecredit-work\/\">CareCredit<\/a>. Payment options vary by country. Be sure to select your country when viewing pricing on our website or give us a call and we&#8217;ll confirm the price.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that financing options vary between countries.<\/p>\n<h2>Welcome to the Club!<\/h2>\n<p>Our dentists and orthodontists will review your scan. Within a week, you&#8217;ll receive an email letting you know if you\u2019re a candidate for our clear aligners. You&#8217;ll see the length of your smile plan, your personal wear schedule, and how your smile will look at the end of your new smile journey. We&#8217;ll include a 3D rendering of your treatment plan that shows how your smile will transform with each set of aligners.<\/p>\n<p>All sets of aligners ship at once to your home. If you have any further questions concerning your new smile journey, we\u2019d love to chat.
