Show off that new grin with the perfect \u201cafter\u201d photo. These 7 tips will help you take an epic selfie to show off your straight, beautiful new smile.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Get the right lighting for your selfie. <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Good lighting is everything. So ideally, you\u2019ll want plenty of natural light to take the perfect selfie. Set up in front of a window so the light is hitting your face \u2013 not coming in from behind you. Or head outside. Overcast skies or in the shade is best because direct sunlight can be harsh in photos.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Keep it simple. <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Find a background that isn\u2019t too busy and is free of clutter.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Be yourself.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Make the moment unique to you and show off your personality. Add a few accessories. Find a cool backdrop. Incorporate a pop of your favorite color. While you don\u2019t want your selfie to be too busy, you still want it to feel authentic to you, so have some fun with it.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Bring in a prop.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Feeling shy? Pose with your pet. Add a coffee cup. Cameo a cute succulent. A nice prop will add visual interest and ground your shot.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Flash those pearly whites.<\/h3>\n<p>Want to take your confidence game to another level? Use our\u00a0<strong>bright on\u2122<\/strong>\u00a0premium teeth whitening to get your teeth to their whitest white.

Do a similar look as your \u201cbefore\u201d photo.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you plan on doing a side-by-side before and after, keep the two shots consistent. Maybe style your hair a similar way, frame the photo the same, and do a similar beauty look so the focus is on your beautiful new smile \u2013 not a dramatic smokey eye or bold lip color.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1845\" src=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/how-to-take-the-perfect-after-selfie-before-afters.gif\" alt=\"how to take the perfect after selfie before afters\" width=\"788\" height=\"525\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. Don&#8217;t over-filter.<\/h3>\n<p>Your teeth are bright and straight. You\u2019re feelin\u2019 yourself. We get it, it\u2019s tempting to go a little overboard on filters. But don\u2019t over-edit your after photo.
