Can I wear aligners if I still have my wisdom teeth? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re answering these commonly asked questions regarding wisdom teeth to help you determine if SmileDirectClub aligners are right for you. We asked the expert, our Lead Dentist, <a href=\"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/meet-your-dentist-smiledirectclub-q-dr-sulitzer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeffrey Sulitzer, DMD<\/a>, to get the answers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How long do I need to wait after having my wisdom teeth removed before I can start with SmileDirectClub?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Typically, you will need to wait 6 weeks after having your third molars (or wisdom teeth) removed before starting SmileDirectClub, recommends Dr. S. If your dentist or surgeon feels it\u2019s safe, you may be able to start earlier with a signed release form from their office.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Can I wear clear aligners if I still have my wisdom teeth?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If your dentist has recommended removal of wisdom teeth, then please follow that direction, Dr. Sulitzer says. Especially if your wisdom teeth growing in has caused your teeth to shift. If not, you can purchase our <a href=\"http:\/\/smiledirectclub.com\/checkout\">impression kit<\/a> or visit a <a href=\"http:\/\/Smiledirectclub.com\/smileshops\">SmileShop<\/a> and a state-licensed dentist or orthodontist will review your smile for you. And if it is determined that aligner treatment isn\u2019t right for you, we will refund the cost of your impression kit. So getting started is totally risk-free.<\/p>\n<p>Take the free 30-second assessment now to find out if you\u2019re a candidate.<\/p>\n\t<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" class=\"btn btn--purple\">\r\n\t\t\tTake Assessment\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We turned to Dr. S to get the answer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":20,"featured_media":1867,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[875,869],"tags":[814,829,818,222,858,856,857,859,860],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2530"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/20"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2530"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2530\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1867"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2530"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2530"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2530"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
