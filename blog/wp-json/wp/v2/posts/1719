But while the aligners might look almost invisible, they won&#8217;t necessarily feel invisible \u2014 because they&#8217;re working hard to give you your best smile. As they adjust your teeth, you&#8217;ll likely need to adjust to wearing them.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some things that might happen when wearing aligners that are totally normal.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Your mouth feels sore<\/h3>\n<p>Your aligners have to put pressure on your teeth to get them moving, and that can feel uncomfortable. They\u2019ll need some time to relax into wearing aligners, but most discomfort should go away after the first few days of a new set of aligners.<\/p>\n<p>When you try a new sport or exercise move for the first time, muscles that aren&#8217;t accustomed to the new movement might feel sore the next day or few days. The same happens with aligners \u2014 you&#8217;re suddenly asking more of your mouth muscles and gums and teeth.<\/p>\n<p>But just like working out, there&#8217;s a payoff if you keep wearing clear aligners. Taking an over-the-counter pain medicine, like ibuprofen, may help ease this pain just as it would easing post-workout muscle pain.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Your teeth feel loose.<\/h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t freak out. This is totally normal when wearing clear aligners.<\/p>\n<p>Some people say teeth feel loose and mobile. That&#8217;s very, very normal, because we are moving them. It&#8217;s a different feeling for customers who have never been through an orthodontic treatment.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Your teeth feel &#8230; funny<\/h3>\n<p>Your aligners have to put pressure on your teeth to get them moving, and that can feel uncomfortable. They\u2019ll need some time to relax into wearing aligners, but most discomfort should go away after the first few days of a new set of aligners. Even if you don\u2019t feel discomfort, you\u2019ll still notice the aligners in your mouth at first and it will probably feel a little odd. Don\u2019t stress \u2013 we promise you\u2019ll get used to it.<\/p>\n<h3>4. The aligners don&#8217;t fit like you expected.<\/h3>\n<p>Maybe they feel too loose, or they aren\u2019t snapping into place correctly. If you\u2019ve been wearing one set of aligners for a while, and they\u2019re getting loose, that\u2019s usually a good sign that the aligners are doing their job. If they aren\u2019t snapping in, you can always use your <a href=\"https:\/\/shop.smiledirectclub.com\/products\/movemints\">Movemints<\/a>, or reach out to our dental team for any tips.<\/p>\n<h3>5. An edge feels rough.<\/h3>\n<p>When you go through your day and start talking, you may notice an edge that <a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/5-ways-make-aligners-more-comfortable\/\">feels rough or sharp<\/a>. This happens. You can use your emery board to lightly file that area. Be sure to file in the same direction to prevent any more rough edges.<\/p>\n<h3>6. You may have a little lisp when wearing clear aligners.<\/h3>\n<p>It won\u2019t last, but, yeah, it\u2019s real. Some people find that they speak with a bit of a lisp when first wearing aligners, but others don\u2019t think it changes the way they talk at all. It depends on the person.<\/p>\n<p>Just stick with it. After a few days, your mouth will adjust, and the lisp go away. And remember: You\u2019re the one paying the most attention to your every word \u2013 most other people will likely never notice.<\/p>\n<h3>7. You take a lot more selfies.<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re just tracking progress (which we recommend) or enjoying the results you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019ll probably see your <a href=\"http:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/take-an-instagram-worthy-after-selfie\/\">camera roll<\/a> fill up with lots of teeth pics.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\t<p style=\"text-align: center\">\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.smiledirectclub.com\/smile_assessment\" class=\"btn btn--purple\">\r\n\t\t\tTake Assessment\t\t<\/a>\r\n\t<\/p>\r\n\t\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From loose teeth to pain or discomfort, here\u2019s how to deal with common side effects of wearing invisible aligners.\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":20,"featured_media":3015,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[875,869],"tags":[172,587,591,589,588,17,18,223,585,222,586],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1719"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/20"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1719"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1719\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3015"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1719"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1719"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blogorigin.wpengine.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1719"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
