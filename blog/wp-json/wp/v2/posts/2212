Retainers are custom-made for your new smile and take 2\u20133 weeks to get to you. Wear your very first retainer set all the time for 2 weeks, just like you would your aligners. This means taking them out only when eating or drinking anything other than cool water. After the 2 weeks are up, or if this isn\u2019t your first set, wear your retainers at night (for at least 8 hours).<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to replace your retainers every 6 months to keep them clean, fresh, and tight-fitting to preserve your gorgeous new grin. Give our Customer Care team a call, and they can set up your account so you get your retainers every 6 months.<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to start your journey to a straighter smile?
